[Andia Happy] "And here we go!"
Andia throws the bridal bouquet behind her as the custom dictates. As it happens... I am the one to catch it.
[Bogdan Happy] "Ohh... lucky catch!"
[Zygmunt Happy] "I wonder who the lucky individual will be!"
That's what I'm wondering too. While I may have caught the bouquet, there's no one in my heart at the moment.
At least not like in the heart of my best friend, Andia, who is the one getting married today! To none other than...
Yarlomila, our rescued villainess. It's been two years since we defeated her and I successfully cleansed the evil from her heart.
Andia was looking for that special someone all her life. And she found her in Yarlomila.
[Dobrava Happy] "I'm so happy for you, Andia."
I hug my best friend, wishing her anything and everything she can dream of.
[Andia Happy] "I already have everything I dreamt about."
She looks with love at Yarlomila who returns the look.
[Yarlomila Happy] "And so do I."
