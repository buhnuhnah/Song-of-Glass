ch1_s1_058861c8		A hero they say? They probably expect a story about someone who slew a dragon or any other monsters.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	6	"[what]"
ch1_s1_4c1f4068		But what about someone who saved a Princess because he was a good man who had made friends?	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	7	"[what]"
ch1_s1_aeba81ee		Let's see if they like it as much as I do.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	8	"[what]"
ch1_s1_149e8b54	d	The Shoemaker Dratevka was a poor man, who travelled around Ostoya and fixed people's shoes and helped everyone in need.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	10	d "[what]"
ch1_s1_a4e3c06d	d	Once, Dratevka came across an ant hill destroyed by a bear. He fixed it and the ants thanked him.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	12	d "[what]"

ch1_s1_bf3a9fb3	d	Yet another time, he encountered ducks who were hungry and fed them some bread. The ducks thanked him.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	14	d "[what]"
ch1_s1_04c882ff		I pause and play a happy tune on the flute to make the show even better. The people look at me with happy faces.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	17	"[what]"
ch1_s1_cb1b3ad6		There is a group of adventurers at one of the tables. They stop talking and look at me expectantly.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	18	"[what]"
ch1_s1_8284af8f	d	One day he came across a tower in the woods. In it, a Princess was imprisoned by an evil Witch.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	20	d "[what]"
ch1_s1_4c05b8c9	d	The Witch told Dratevka she would release the Princess if he completes two tasks for her and solves a riddle.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	21	d "[what]"
ch1_s1_08fe36fb		I pause again to play something dramatic.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	24	"[what]"
ch1_s1_3dd41014	d	And so, Dratevka was tasked with picking poppy seeds out of a sack of sand by the morning.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	25	d "[what]"
ch1_s1_5bdd7bf9		Another pause and another tune on the flute.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	28	"[what]"

ch1_s1_ebbb74a4	d	He felt desperate. How was he supposed to complete such a task in such a short period of time?	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	31	d "[what]"
ch1_s1_5cb1c75c	d	Then his friends came to the rescue - the ants!	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	33	d "[what]"
ch1_s1_68a75a81	d	They completed the task for him and when the Witch came to see the result in the morning, everything was sorted in neat piles.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	34	d "[what]"

ch1_s1_93ec5ebf	d	The Witch then tasked Dratevka to find a golden key in the lake. How was he supposed to find a small key at the bottom of a giant pool of water?	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	42	d "[what]"

ch1_s1_cdc842eb	"Customer Child"	Awesome!	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	45	"Customer Child" "[what]"
ch1_s1_aaae3b9f	d	And so only the last test stood before Dratevka - the riddle. The Witch led him to a room, where nine maidens sat. All of them wore the same clothes and their faces were hidden under veils.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	47	d "[what]"
ch1_s1_676dd295	d	The Witch told him "Now find your Princess!" and cackled.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	48	d "[what]"
ch1_s1_46d7e5d4		I make another dramatic pause to play my flute. The crowd is focused on me. I enjoy their attention.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	51	"[what]"
ch1_s1_6d4fee14	"Customer Man"	Oh no! How will he be able to do that? He can't tell them apart!	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	52	"Customer Man" "[what]"
ch1_s1_033f3ad0	d	And again, Dratevka's friends, the bees, came to the rescue. They flew through the window and circled the head of one of the maidens. Trusting his friends, Dratevka chose her.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	54	d "[what]"

ch1_s1_6d5ac11e	d	Then they married and lived happily ever after in the witch's castle.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	56	d "[what]"
ch1_s1_e9ce1fe6		I end my story with a victorious tune. I really love this one and the crowd does too. I wish I had friends like Dratevka. Trust and camaraderie is invaluable.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	59	"[what]"
ch1_s1_d2db9f9f		The crowd claps and cheers. Money gets thrown on the coat I had spread under my feet.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	60	"[what]"
ch1_s1_7fe5fc63	"Customer Man"	Tell us another story, Dobrava!	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	61	"Customer Man" "[what]"

ch1_s1_6b2f1525	d	I'm very sorry, but I need to take a break now. All this storytelling and playing got me hungry.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	63	d "[what]"
ch1_s1_6d93118f	"Innkeeper Marysia"	I'll get some food ready for you.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	64	"Innkeeper Marysia" "[what]"
ch1_s1_46e58b41		Marysia the innkeeper feeds me for free. After all, thanks to me, customers come to the tavern and stay here longer. There is no one in Ostoya who does not like a good song and story.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	65	"[what]"
ch1_s1_294bbac0		And I'm the very best at what I do.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	66	"[what]"
ch1_s1_420a3e5e	"Customer Child"	Oh nooo! I want to hear another story!	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	67	"Customer Child" "[what]"
ch1_s1_6a7a006f	"Customer Man"	Later, my son. Let the bard rest. It's well-deserved after such a beautiful performance.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	68	"Customer Man" "[what]"
ch1_s2_94f9a79e		The crowd disperses, returning to their now cold meals. I look down at my flute and start to clean it.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	74	"[what]"
ch1_s2_9a61e253	"???"	Bard... your name is Dobrava, right?	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	75	"???" "[what]"
ch1_s2_a67931d4		I look up again, surprised. The pretty adventurers are still gathered around me.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	82	"[what]"
ch1_s2_46afb804	d	...! Yes, that's right. I'm Dobrava.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	83	d "[what]"
ch1_s2_d01dbceb		There's a handsome half-elven man with two daggers at his hips. Must be some kind of rogue.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	86	"[what]"
ch1_s2_4a1b3ea8		Another beautiful man, this one a human in full armor, stands to his left. Some sort of fighter, probably.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	89	"[what]"
ch1_s2_6bb518bc		And a gorgeous elven lady with a stern expression stands slightly behind them. A pointy, wide-brimmed hat gives her away as some sort of mage.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	92	"[what]"
ch1_s2_d1ae8949		Ohhh quit staring, Dobrava. So what if you suddenly got approached by so many pretty faces? And bodies? You're not too shabby-looking yourself, after all...	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	95	"[what]"
ch1_s2_0a24aada	d	How can I help you, handsome?	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	97	d "[what]"
ch1_s2_4248584c		Yes, let's approach this in the usual manner!	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	98	"[what]"
ch1_s2_21499cde	z	...Ha, I see you are a lady made of the same clay as I am. My name is Zygmunt.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	100	z "[what]"
ch1_s2_48a834ae	d	Not a lady, but nice to meet you too.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	105	d "[what]"
ch1_s2_a237c260	z	Ah, I meant no offence.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	106	z "[what]"
ch1_s2_f670f7e2	d	I know. Thus none was taken.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	107	d "[what]"
ch1_s2_7ce9124f	d	I appreciate you recognizing me as a lady.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	111	d "[what]"
ch1_s2_63a4b075	"Innkeeper Marysia"	You were not much of a lady that one time when you...	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	112	"Innkeeper Marysia" "[what]"
ch1_s2_6340a1b2	d	Quiet, Marysia! I told you not to speak about it! Especially not in front of strangers...	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	114	d "[what]"
ch1_s2_e6fe4900		Zygmunt laughs openly at that and the other man chuckles too. The elven woman looks like she does not want to be part of this conversation, cringing visibly.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	117	"[what]"
ch1_s2_2_5980f6d4		I look at the other members of the party expectantly.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	123	"[what]"
ch1_s2_2_47f90ee6	b	Ahh... my name is Bogdan. I stab things for a living.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	124	b "[what]"
ch1_s2_2_971e5910	a	A very eloquent way to introduce yourself, Bogdan. I applaud your creativity. I'm Andia.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	125	a "[what]"
ch1_s2_2_ae871ed0	d	Are you the kind of wizard who blows things up?	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	127	d "[what]"
ch1_s2_2_9dacdbb7	a	Gods forbid, I am not. My element is more subtle than that. I work with wind.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	128	a "[what]"
ch1_s2_2_83f77c1a	z	And I also stab things for a living as well as try to talk them out of their clothes.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	130	z "[what]"
ch1_s2_2_429c6cb4	d	You are a man of words, truly.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	131	d "[what]"
ch1_s2_2_3654a699		They seem like nice folks. But what do they want with me?	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	132	"[what]"
ch1_s2_2_7e7bac06	d	So... what brings you to me? Did you like the story? My playing? Or just my looks?	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	133	d "[what]"
ch1_s2_2_66a8935b	z	All of it, of course! As you can see we are a party of three adventurers: a frontline fighter, a stealthy rogue, and a powerful wizard. What is missing in our lives then?	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	134	z "[what]"
ch1_s2_2_e54edd40	b	...Money?	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	136	b "[what]"
ch1_s2_2_5a9f886e	a	Gods, help us!	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	137	a "[what]"
ch1_s2_2_2247e1ac	z	Well, that too. But I wasn't asking you, I was asking Dobrava. What do you think?	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	138	z "[what]"
ch1_s2_2_17ee5e76		What do I think they are missing?	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	139	"[what]"
ch1_s2_2_4bf4ea1b	d	You don't seem to be very well-equipped.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	145	d "[what]"
ch1_s2_2_03075257	b	My sword is good for stabbing people!	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	147	b "[what]"
ch1_s2_2_4f3eac90	z	Yes, I am sure of that... after thte last maiden who ran away after spending a night with you.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	149	z "[what]"
ch1_s2_2_7689a01f	b	But that's not what I meant at all!	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	151	b "[what]"
ch1_s2_2_4f5f4e8a	z	But yes, we are indeed missing magical items. Though that's not why we approached you.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	153	z "[what]"
ch1_s2_2_93b313ec	d	This is the first time I saw you around here. Are you a new group? Not famous yet?	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	158	d "[what]"
ch1_s2_2_0c231336	z	It pains my heart, you've never heard of us: The... what are we called again?	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	160	z "[what]"
ch1_s2_2_561b6b76	a	I'd rather not be called anything as a group than go by a cringy name you come up with.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	161	a "[what]"
ch1_s2_2_8d4baf03	z	You wound me. But it's true, my sense of naming is terrible. Maybe Dobrava could help us later.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	162	z "[what]"
ch1_s2_2_7b496beb	z	But that's not why we approached you.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	164	z "[what]"
ch1_s2_2_6c759d0a	d	Are you seeking knowledge? I know any stories about the heroes and villains of these lands.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	169	d "[what]"
ch1_s2_2_e4f74955	a	And I am very interested in learning everything you know. Are you familiar with...	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	171	a "[what]"
ch1_s2_2_16eaba59	z	Now now, Andia!	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	173	z "[what]"
ch1_s2_2_046884db	a	But...	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	174	a "[what]"
ch1_s2_2_8627d37e	z	When Andia starts, she won't leave you be. And while I appreciate your knowledge, that's not why we approached you.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	175	z "[what]"
ch1_s2_3_ee53f51c	d	Then why did you?	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	180	d "[what]"
ch1_s2_3_39455583	z	Do you know any healing spells?	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	182	z "[what]"
ch1_s2_3_dc1c6eeb	d	...Yes, of course. Healing songs were part of my training as a bard and I'm knowledgeable about herbalism and alchemy as well as first aid.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	183	d "[what]"
ch1_s2_3_5ec6307d	z	See! Told you she knows her stuff!	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	185	z "[what]"
ch1_s2_3_a267e31c	b	They seem very capable indeed!	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	188	b "[what]"
ch1_s2_3_db795ef3	b	She seems very capable indeed!	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	190	b "[what]"
ch1_s2_3_7bd1f2f0	a	Reluctant as I am to agree with you on anything, I must admit you are right this time.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	192	a "[what]"
ch1_s2_3_6ba1ce3d	z	A rare occasion!	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	193	z "[what]"
ch1_s2_3_e7d6bcba	d	I still don't understand. What do healing spells have to do with you approaching me?	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	194	d "[what]"
ch1_s2_3_a1f07014	z	Well of course I want you to join us!	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	195	z "[what]"
ch1_s2_3_19b83ead	d	Join... you...?	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	197	d "[what]"
ch1_s2_3_c1e2ac2c	a	Yes, as the party's healer. An adventurer.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	198	a "[what]"
ch1_s2_3_2861c895	z	Life as a bard may be nice, but are you interested in trying something more action-oriented?	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	199	z "[what]"
ch1_s2_3_b95efa92	d	I...	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	200	d "[what]"
ch1_s2_3_7dddc2bf	b	...In watching us stab monsters and having a new story to tell and sing about?	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	201	b "[what]"
ch1_s2_3_a8699778	d	Well...	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	202	d "[what]"
ch1_s2_3_61062112	a	...In travelling the land with us and gathering ancient knowledge and uncovering forgotten lore?	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	203	a "[what]"
ch1_s2_3_1523fe20	d	...	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	204	d "[what]"
ch1_s2_3_9f332063		Am I? I was trained with the possibility of being an adventuring bard, rather than one who always sits in the same tavern, telling stories and singing songs for anyone who wanted to listen.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	205	"[what]"
ch1_s2_3_daa48749		But... fighting actual monsters rather than singing about them? Is that something I can do?	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	206	"[what]"
ch1_s2_3_8b4beef9	a	...You're not afraid, are you?	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	207	a "[what]"
ch1_s2_3_29c310a6	b	Maybe she just doesn't like us...	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	209	b "[what]"
ch1_s2_3_c5800eb2	z	Hush, let her think.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	211	z "[what]"
ch1_s2_3_97e0661a		Even if I was scared, I would never admit that to their beautiful faces!	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	212	"[what]"
ch1_s2_3_ef8d97e7	d	Who? Me? Scared? What do you take me for?! Of course I'm not afraid! What would I be afraid of? After all, I would be with brave adventurers who will protect me!	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	214	d "[what]"
ch1_s2_3_a18bdcc1	d	I'll do it!	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	215	d "[what]"
ch1_s2_3_78c392bf		...What?	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	216	"[what]"
ch1_s2_3_3d497e4f		Did I just... agree to join them?	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	217	"[what]"
ch1_s2_3_b0d21dbc	z	Brilliant!	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	219	z "[what]"
ch1_s2_3_534f7f6a	a	Happy to have you with us!	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	221	a "[what]"
ch1_s2_3_8ab5d0e5	b	Yay! Now I can actually be in less pain after being bitten by a monster!	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	223	b "[what]"
ch1_s2_3_78172f92		...What have I done?!	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	224	"[what]"
ch1_s2_3_edd485d2	z	Welcome to the party, Dobrava! I hope our time together will bring us many riches, glory, and knowledge! As well as many stories for you to tell!	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	225	z "[what]"
ch1_s2_3_98da3055	d	...yes, thank you.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	227	d "[what]"
ch1_s3_f5ed2af9		After eating dinner with my new adventuring party, the time comes - my first quest. There's a first time for everything, I guess.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	240	"[what]"
ch1_s3_cd0c245d	a	There's this Elven ruin nearby I'm interested in. It's about 500 years old, from before the time-	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	242	a "[what]"
ch1_s3_1111cdea	z	And we are sure to find some treasure in here!	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	245	z "[what]"
ch1_s3_f0eff9e3	b	And monsters to stab!	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	247	b "[what]"
ch1_s3_2_ca4d0229	d	Please tell us more about the history of the ruin, Andia.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	261	d "[what]"
ch1_s3_2_1f38c5cd	a	Finally someone interested in more than just riches and combat. Very well. As you know, Dobrava, Ostoya was the land of elves, called Eduan.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	263	a "[what]"
ch1_s3_2_2ec873e2	a	That was before the Darkness came and swallowed the whole continent, making vast areas of it unlivable. The Elves could not stand living among the shorter-living races and most of them left for the New Land and Kingdoms of the Sun and Moon.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	264	a "[what]"
ch1_s3_2_c1d3916a	a	But their ruins remained. Many still hold secrets behind locked doors as few people these days can read the ancient Elven tongue.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	265	a "[what]"
ch1_s3_2_52259539	d	Do you know the Elven tongue, Andia?	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	266	d "[what]"
ch1_s3_2_f33f29c3	a	I would not call myself an expert on it, but I can read and understand many of the words.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	268	a "[what]"

ch1_s5_2_cf5c260f		But Bogdan is quicker.He beheads the man when he is mere inches away from us, poised to strike. The bandit's clawed hand barely misses me.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	569	"[what]"

ch1_s5_5_fe500a8d		A minute later, a small ball of fire incinerates the bandit's corpse, its limbs still writhing despite the flames. The smell of a burning body is disgusting. I move a bit away from the party and lose my lunch.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	623	"[what]"

ch1_s5_5_02f04fcc		After a moment I let go of him and look at the rest of the party. Bogdan and Andia are smiling at me and Andia even winks. What's that about?	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	661	"[what]"
ch1_s5_5_c18aee2b		I pass by Zygmunt and go to Bogdan. It's a bit awkward at first when I hug him, though he hugs me back regardless.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	669	"[what]"
ch1_s5_5_b484cc50		But when I hide my face in his chest, he pats my head and I no longer feel like this is wrong. He smells so nice too, a very manly scent which I cannot quite describe.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	672	"[what]"
ch1_s5_5_7b2ddef9		It feels safe, like all is right in the world. After a moment I let go of him and look at the rest of the party. Zygmunt and Andia are smiling at me and Andia even winks. What's that about?	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	676	"[what]"
ch1_s5_5_71f1000c		I pass by Zygmunt and go to Andia. She is very surprised when I hug her and takes a moment to hug me back.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	683	"[what]"
ch1_s5_5_8229b2b7		But when she does I feel warmth and calmness like I've never felt before. She smells so nice too, of spring flowers.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	685	"[what]"
ch1_s5_5_d34faf7d		Zygmunt and Bogdan are smiling at me and Zygmunt even winks. What's that about?	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	689	"[what]"
ch1_s5_5_eeb5ddbb		No, this is too awkward. I put my hands around my waist and hug myself.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	692	"[what]"
ch1_s5_5_8ed5dc56		The others look sad that I haven't gone to any of them for comfort... but I don't know them well enough. It would just feel weird.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	693	"[what]"
ch1_s5_6_86a73053		There's something more pressing to ask about.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	697	"[what]"
ch1_s5_6_6a5c4108	d	What was that... thing?	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	699	d "[what]"
ch1_s5_6_238e87cb	b	A type of undead...	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	703	b "[what]"
ch1_s5_6_85b5133b	a	A walking corpse...	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	704	a "[what]"
ch1_s5_6_f6a01769	z	A zombie.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	705	z "[what]"
ch1_s5_6_e062e6cf	d	Oh my gods! Do you mean to say that thing wasn't alive... and yet it was walking?!	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	707	d "[what]"
ch1_s5_6_072bd42e	z	That would be correct.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	708	z "[what]"
ch1_s5_6_4f65726d	d	Have you met things like that before?!	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	709	d "[what]"
ch1_s5_6_dc4dc664	b	Several times.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	711	b "[what]"
ch1_s5_6_407b0e0c	a	And more often in this area than we would have liked.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	712	a "[what]"
ch1_s5_6_168c48dd	z	We should be on high alert as we proceed to the ruin.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	713	z "[what]"
ch1_s5_6_c376623a	d	We're continuing?!	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	714	d "[what]"
ch1_s5_6_b575c289	b	Of course!	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	716	b "[what]"
ch1_s5_6_793d2f48	d	But what if there are more of them?	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	718	d "[what]"
ch1_s5_6_180cf01b	b	Don't worry. We'll protect you. All you have to do is stay back and heal us after the fight if we get hurt.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	719	b "[what]"
ch1_s5_6_5dea9237	d	...ok.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	720	d "[what]"
ch1_s5_6_c97994b4		I have some spells I could use during the fight, but am I strong enough to use them despite my fear?	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	721	"[what]"
ch1_s5_6_e5b98faa	a	You don't have to force yourself, Dobrava. The first few times are hard. So just take it easy. We're happy to have you here. Right, guys?	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	723	a "[what]"
ch1_s5_6_b575c289_1	b	Of course!	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	724	b "[what]"
ch1_s5_6_757b063c	z	Always!	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	726	z "[what]"
ch1_s5_6_6d0a2188		I feel reassured, but I can't help but feel scared. I can't back away now.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	728	"[what]"
ch1_s5_6_821a5903		I gave my word that I would help them. And giving a promise is the most important thing in the world. You can't go back on your word once it's given.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	729	"[what]"
ch1_s5_6_7808b38e	d	Alright, let's go!	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	731	d "[what]"
ch1_s5_6_490a99c2		They all look relieved with my renewed confidence and smile at me as we go off the road into the forest proper.	game/story scripts/ch1.1-5.rpy	732	"[what]"
ch1_s6_b013db98		After walking for a few minutes we reach the elven ruin. It feels like an ancient place, long abandoned. At the same time I feel somewhat uneasy. What if there are more of those creatures?	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	12	"[what]"
ch1_s6_b9b84a7c		Zygmunt moves first on high alert. He is very handsome like this in his element.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	15	"[what]"
ch1_s6_c4b87526		Come to think of it, they are all gorgeous, focused like that.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	18	"[what]"
ch1_s6_8059182e		If I was not so terrified I would have admired Bogdan's prowess in combat and Andia's ability to recite such complex incantations.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	19	"[what]"
ch1_s6_eece4e34		I have to admit that despite their goofiness outside work, when they are actually serious they're quite capable.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	20	"[what]"
ch1_s6_5a715cc3		We reach the remains of the wall and Zygmunt jumps over it. A few seconds pass and we hear a click.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	21	"[what]"
ch1_s6_106a4990	z	Another trap disarmed!	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	28	z "[what]"
ch1_s6_87ba4d7c		Bogdan steps on top of the foundation and reaches out to us.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	29	"[what]"
ch1_s6_6f2820e0		Andia ignores his hand and uses wind magic to levitate slightly. This allows her to pass to the other side on her own. I guess she is too prideful to take anyone's help.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	30	"[what]"
ch1_s6_d2837127		I take Bogdan's hand and he smiles at me.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	32	"[what]"
ch1_s6_b619fc91	b	And up you go, precious!	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	34	b "[what]"
ch1_s6_d36ddf97	b	And up you go, Princess!	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	36	b "[what]"
ch1_s6_e82d2524		He moves his other hand to my waist and raises me up.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	38	"[what]"
ch1_s6_fb7e4e30	d	Whoa!	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	39	d "[what]"
ch1_s6_f060c447		And puts me down gently on the other side. Zygmunt watches us. He looks annoyed and Andia snickers, covering her lips with her hand.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	42	"[what]"
ch1_s6_7cc97a54	a	But this ruin is amazing! It's definitely more than a few hundred years old. Do you see the engraving on that wall? It tells the history of...	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	45	a "[what]"
ch1_s6_e52b9ace		She continues blabbering but, as much as those things interest me normally, right now I don't feel safe enough to focus on stories.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	46	"[what]"
ch1_s6_eabbbf1d		We move deeper and deeper into the ruin, passing chambers with sarcophages and sculptures. Everything is covered by a thick layer of dust and cobwebs.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	47	"[what]"
ch1_s6_5ace651c		Luckily for Bogdan, we don't encounter any giant spiders.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	48	"[what]"
ch1_s6_ca1af6f0		Andia has taken out a scroll and is making sketches. I look over her shoulder.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	49	"[what]"
ch1_s6_5449e832	d	Wow, your drawings are amazing!	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	51	d "[what]"
ch1_s6_e085124b	a	Thank you. Drawing and painting are my hobbies outside of adventuring and history.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	52	a "[what]"
ch1_s6_b0cf4dbd	z	Shh...	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	54	z "[what]"
ch1_s6_1461f26f		I want to talk about it more but Zygmunt tells us to be quiet.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	55	"[what]"
ch1_s6_bfe936bc		Too late though, because suddenly from both of our sides skeletons emerge. There are six on the left side and two on the right.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	57	"[what]"
ch1_s6_b8b4ff76		Some come out from the open sarcophagi. Others join them from the corridors.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	58	"[what]"
ch1_s6_9cd5ed3e		Bogdan curses under his breath and pulls out his sword. Zygmunt and Andia draw their weapons too.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	62	"[what]"
ch1_s6_ae30fab1		They gesture to each other-a sign language I don't understand. Probably something they came up with for themselves in the years they've adventured together.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	63	"[what]"
ch1_s6_35aeaa88		The skeletons are scary but I'm not as terrified as with that zombie. I know those things are dead after all, we just have to stop them from moving.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	65	"[what]"
ch1_s6_2_62c869cb		I play a song of hope and heroism. My magic surrounds the other party members.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	77	"[what]"
ch1_s6_2_5849a758	b	Wow, I feel so strong and confident now!	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	79	b "[what]"
ch1_s6_2_324d4bee	d	Just don't let it get to your head!	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	80	d "[what]"
ch1_s6_2_d936315a		Bogdan attacks the skeletons on the left with Zygmunt supporting him by shooting arrows at their feet to make them trip.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	81	"[what]"
ch1_s6_2_804c2a95		Meanwhile, Andia creates a strong blast of wind which shatters the skeletons on the right.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	82	"[what]"
ch1_s6_2_7d3fa2ec		The fight doesn't even last a minute, that's how capable my companions are.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	85	"[what]"
ch1_s6_2_7694010e	d	Anybody hurt?	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	87	d "[what]"
ch1_s6_2_8f4fca7c	z	Of course not. Thanks to your buff we're stronger than ever!	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	89	z "[what]"
ch1_s6_2_7164d580		Was my song really so powerful? Huh. I guess my healing skills aren't needed after all!	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	90	"[what]"
ch1_s6_3_c246c63d		It's better if I sit this out and conserve my energy for healing.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	94	"[what]"
ch1_s6_3_d936315a		Bogdan attacks the skeletons on the left with Zygmunt supporting him by shooting arrows at their feet to make them trip.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	96	"[what]"
ch1_s6_3_804c2a95		Meanwhile, Andia creates a strong blast of wind which shatters the skeletons on the right.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	97	"[what]"
ch1_s6_3_7d3fa2ec		The fight doesn't even last a minute, that's how capable my companions are.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	101	"[what]"
ch1_s6_3_7694010e	d	Anybody hurt?	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	102	d "[what]"
ch1_s6_3_c0ce9831	b	Yes, one of them scratched me.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	103	b "[what]"
ch1_s6_3_df4e153a	d	Let me heal that.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	104	d "[what]"
ch1_s6_3_47752930		I play a song of healing for Bogdan and his wound closes.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	106	"[what]"
ch1_s6_3_590302e4	b	Thank you!	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	108	b "[what]"
ch1_s6_3_f47417f3	d	That's what I'm here for!	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	110	d "[what]"
ch1_s7_7398b65b		As we move even deeper into the ruin we find some ancient Elven gold coins and minor jewels. Nothing awfully exciting, but it should pay for a comfortable life for the four of us for a week.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	129	"[what]"
ch1_s7_cdd28ea9		Eventually, after dispatching two more hordes of skeletons, we enter what looks like a throne room... well, what was a throne room eons ago.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	130	"[what]"
ch1_s7_07386c77		It's a beautiful place with many columns and sculptures. The roof is missing and we can see the sky. There is a skeleton in front of the throne wearing robes.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	131	"[what]"
ch1_s7_a985548c		It's quite far away from us, on the other side of the long, cathedral-like room. At least 50 feet away from us. It doesn't immediately attack us, so we take some time to assess the situation.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	132	"[what]"
ch1_s7_5cd42a53		A skeleton wearing robes is probably an undead warlock or another magician of sorts. The right thing to do is to prevent it from using magic somehow.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	133	"[what]"
ch1_s7_ab428c6b	b	I guess we're at the boss fight!	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	135	b "[what]"
ch1_s7_b4becb3a	a	Ugh...	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	137	a "[what]"
ch1_s7_14c98c73	z	Look at that shiny thing behind it! I wonder what it is!	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	139	z "[what]"
ch1_s7_7db7c2ea	d	Looks like some sort of scepter to me! And it looks beautiful... what a find!	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	141	d "[what]"
ch1_s7_dd8264a5	z	I wonder how much it's worth...	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	142	z "[what]"
ch1_s7_16c1bb37		Our excited talk is interrupted by the skeleton firing a bolt of dark energy at our feet. We all jump away just in time to avoid injury.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	147	"[what]"
ch1_s7_6b8eb9f5	d	You piece of shit! Those were my favourite shoes!	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	149	d "[what]"
ch1_s7_db4319a1		Why would I wear my favourite shoes to elven ruins? Well, I have not shared this information with anyone yet... but I'm actually a shoe collector and all of my shoes are my favourites.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	150	"[what]"
ch1_s7_de41d2c5		Shoes are serious business. They are a gift from gods. They should be worshipped, not scorched by dark energy.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	151	"[what]"
ch1_s7_9ccb0693		Fueling my anger into my song, I play the Silent Song, creating a field that seals the use of magic in the back half of the cathedral for those standing in it.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	153	"[what]"
ch1_s7_149e8499	d	Try casting any spells now, you bastard!	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	154	d "[what]"
ch1_s7_3039db9c	z	Wow, that's amazing!	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	158	z "[what]"
ch1_s7_38ff23cc		Zygmunt shoots an arrow after arrow at the skeleton that is now confused. The enemy is unable to cast any spells while Andia is outside of the field of silence, so she casts a blast of wind.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	159	"[what]"
ch1_s7_612ce3df		Meanwhile Bogdan runs up to the skeleton warlock and whacks it with his big sword.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	160	"[what]"
ch1_s7_c2170bc5		After a few attacks from everyone, the skeleton begins to turn to dust, defeated. I know this sounds like an easy boss fight, but it was only this simple thanks to it being unable to cast spells.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	162	"[what]"
ch1_s7_3f5ff501		Still, as I look at my companions they all look tired. Fighting takes a toll on the body after all. That's why it is best for fights to be brief and to the point.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	163	"[what]"
ch1_s7_e82ede7d	d	This was actually fun!	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	165	d "[what]"
ch1_s7_2f77fd24	a	I'm glad you thought so!	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	167	a "[what]"
ch1_s7_fcc40e7c	z	It would not have been so easy without you.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	168	z "[what]"
ch1_s7_fa218c98	b	Thank you, Dobrava.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	169	b "[what]"
ch1_s7_8899c4bb	d	My pleasure.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	170	d "[what]"
ch1_s7_7ebb58ed		We move closer to the artifact on the throne.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	172	"[what]"
ch1_s7_680e8cdf	z	Oh no... how disappointing. It's just the handle of a scepter...	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	177	z "[what]"
ch1_s7_eb3c8e17	d	It's still beautiful though. Might be worth something.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	178	d "[what]"
ch1_s7_3ccaf155	a	There are inscriptions in Elven on the handle... but they are so small...	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	179	a "[what]"
ch1_s7_699522b6		She reaches out to take the handle and look at it more closely but Bogdan grabs her hand and stops her.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	180	"[what]"
ch1_s7_11521510	b	Wait! What if it's cursed?	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	182	b "[what]"
ch1_s7_de47b9c2	d	We should take it regardless. Better for it to be with us than in these musty old ruins.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	183	d "[what]"
ch1_s7_91c0d631		We all look at each other. After a few moments, Zygmunt takes the handle through a piece of blessed cloth and wraps it in it.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	185	"[what]"
ch1_s7_e8c246fe		The cloth {i}should{/i} stop any curse from spreading to us, but when you're working with items this old? Who knows.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	186	"[what]"
ch1_s7_124dbaac		For now though, nothing happens. Hopefully it stays that way.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	187	"[what]"
ch1_s7_4d4c35ef		With our loot acquired and the ruin explored we make our way back to the tavern.	game/story scripts/ch1.6-7.rpy	188	"[what]"
ch1_s8_ffbb483a		Back in the tavern, my companions book rooms for the night. We decide not to talk about today's events until morning and instead take time to recuperate.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	12	"[what]"
ch1_s8_3f5b5e75	z	We tend to spend the evenings separately, Dobrava, as each of us relaxes better doing different things.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	13	z "[what]"
ch1_s8_a5fe9cb1	a	You are welcome to do whatever you want or join one of us.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	14	a "[what]"
ch1_s8_c1d53f90	d	What's everyone going to do?	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	15	d "[what]"
ch1_s8_846e64d8	a	I'll be in my room painting.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	16	a "[what]"
ch1_s8_42717820	b	I'm going outside to train.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	17	b "[what]"
ch1_s8_0de8e97d	z	And I will be in the tavern playing cards.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	18	z "[what]"
ch1_s8_ab56c4f9		Who do I want to spend the evening with?	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	19	"[what]"
ch1_s8_andia_963507fd	d	I'd like to watch you paint, if that's not a problem, Andia?	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	38	d "[what]"
ch1_s8_andia_78da0ffa	a	Not at all. I'm happy you want to spend time with me. Let's go upstairs then.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	40	a "[what]"
ch1_s8_andia_db236639		We leave the guys and go up to Andia's room.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	41	"[what]"
ch1_s8_andia_3b7ca4fd		Andia's room is very similar to mine. I suppose all the tavern guestrooms are the same.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	48	"[what]"
ch1_s8_andia_09da10e3		Andia takes out some sheets of paper and painting supplies from her satchel by the bed.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	49	"[what]"
ch1_s8_andia_0ad40467	d	What are you going to paint?	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	51	d "[what]"
ch1_s8_andia_559b7537	a	Hmm...	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	53	a "[what]"
ch1_s8_andia_688b4dcf		She looks at me for a moment, thinking.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	54	"[what]"
ch1_s8_andia_6782db00	a	How about you? Would you mind?	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	56	a "[what]"
ch1_s8_andia_38bbe5c4		That's a new expression I've never seen before on her. She's... blushing?	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	58	"[what]"
ch1_s8_andia1_fc91b4c7	d	Of course! I'd be very happy if you painted me!	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	67	d "[what]"

ch1_s8_andia1_2929c333	a	The truth is... I didn't want to be forced into an arranged marriage when I came of age. So, right before that, I ran away from home and hid in Priporovy Forest.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	82	a "[what]"
ch1_s8_andia1_c0fb254d	a	The Krasny Ludek found me and took me into their hidden town. There, they taught me magic.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	83	a "[what]"

ch1_s8_bogdan_d07f245b		Now I've made him sad, but it's better to be clear when we've just started getting to know each other.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	165	"[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan_b43dd4fa	d	Don't be upset. Friends are a great thing too. Friendship is as powerful as Andia's magic or a swing of your sword!	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	166	d "[what]"

ch1_s8_bogdan2_80c1a956		Bogdan and I make our way outside. The tavern is located just off the main road through the forest so the calm and serene woods greet us when we exit the tavern.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	180	"[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan2_0a961e02		Bogdan leads me to a clearing just a few minutes away from the tavern.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	181	"[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan2_7e808d53		I watch as Bogdan takes his sword off his back and starts swinging it, showing off various complicated stances. I can't help but feel impressed.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	182	"[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan2_8b593692		It doesn't take long before he takes off his shirt and I can also be impressed watching his muscles flex in the light of the setting sun.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	183	"[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan2_41dd9ccc		Gods, what a view!	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	185	"[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan2_8b681dce		At some point Bogdan stops to drink water and looks at me.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	186	"[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan2_0ea378a5	b	Why is your face so red?	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	188	b "[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan2_bbf4a190		Uh-oh. I must be blushing really hard for it to be visible on my darker complexion.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	189	"[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan2_acd3a245	d	It's nothing!	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	190	d "[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan2_1d82bea0		Bogdan approaches me. He kneels in front of where I'm sitting on a log and looks at me with worry in his eyes.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	191	"[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan2_41d26f02	b	Whoa... your ears are red too.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	192	b "[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan2_9c842a64	d	I'm saying it's nothing!	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	193	d "[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan2_c90fa0fb		He ignores me and, with a focused expression, places one hand on each of our foreheads.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	194	"[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan2_050c4a05	b	Hmm.. you seem to have a fever, Dobrava!	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	196	b "[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan2_8c88c749		How do I get out of this? I don't know, but one thing's for sure: I'm too embarrassed to explain it to him!	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	197	"[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan2_4dcec98f	d	Nothing is wrong... I'm fine, really.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	200	d "[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan2_fa34d63f	b	Why are you lying to me?!	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	202	b "[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan2_276caf95	d	Yes, it seems I do have a fever.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	205	d "[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan2_641d96bc	b	Figured!	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	207	b "[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan3_357edfce		Uh-oh. Now he's angry.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	210	"[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan3_c10ecb33		Before I can react, Bogdan takes me in his arms.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	212	"[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan3_d5ab90af	d	What are you doing?! Put me down!	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	214	d "[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan3_5bfc71fc	b	You're sick. I have to take care of you. My mother always told me a warrior's strength is in how they can protect others.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	215	b "[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan3_916bb1c7		This is the first time I've heard about Bogdan's mother.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	216	"[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan4_3064aba5	d	Your mother, Bogdan... would you tell me more about her?	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	226	d "[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan4_04d1c76e	b	Ah, my mother! Her name is Vshebora. She's an amazing warrior! She was the one who taught me to use swords, axes, and maces. She can kill monsters like no one else I know.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	228	b "[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan4_28fe7f13		Bogdan's mother is probably the source of his fascination with being a strong warrior and powerful weapons.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	229	"[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan4_3f5bdef3	d	That's amazing! Where is she now?	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	231	d "[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan4_c5ca2fcd	b	Probably somewhere to the west, adventuring at the border of Darkness.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	233	b "[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan4_91b0fd96	d	Isn't that the most dangerous place in Ostoya?	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	235	d "[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan4_f8e0cb77	b	It is! But my mother is powerful! No one can defeat her!	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	236	b "[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan4_aa7a6ace	d	Of course!	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	238	d "[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan4_34caaeaf		I can't help but feel worried though. There are all manner of abominations, creatures from nightmares that no one can imagine, lurking at the edge between Ostoya and the Darkness-eaten lands.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	240	"[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan4_557c989f		But someone has to protect us, the ones trying to just live our lives in this land, from the Darkness.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	241	"[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan4_e31dc181		And those courageous people are Ostoya's most powerful adventurers.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	242	"[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan4_0bed2cad		I guess Bogdan's mother is one such individual. I feel grateful to her for both giving birth to Bogdan and dedicating her life to protecting others.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	243	"[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan4_c53a7472	d	Do you hope to one day join Vshebora on the border, Bogdan?	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	244	d "[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan4_ee5a515f	b	Yes, of course! But she said I need to get even stronger first! She'll come pick me up in a few years. I hope the rest of the party will come too!	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	246	b "[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan4_f3920d2c		This is the most I've ever heard Bogdan speak. I can tell how important his mother is to him.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	247	"[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan4_d1871975	d	Thank you for sharing this with me.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	248	d "[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan4_c4c3ef35	b	Ehh... no need to thank me. If you want to know something, just ask.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	250	b "[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan5_8cb59999		The subject is probably too private for Bogdan to talk about with someone he met just a few hours ago.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	255	"[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan5_93743934		We walk back to the tavern in silence.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	256	"[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan6_6438af76	z	Whoa... what's wrong?!	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	270	z "[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan6_6d52d0b7		Zygmunt leaves his table where he was playing cards with some other tavern patrons and runs up to us.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	271	"[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan6_1f933f7a	b	Dobrava is sick.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	273	b "[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan6_301fdc3c	d	I feel much better now, Bogdan. You can put me down.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	274	d "[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan6_1755448e		But he doesn't. Instead he makes his way up the stairs to my room.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	275	"[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan6_0b8819a4	z	What's wrong with her?	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	277	z "[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan6_9d60eb08	b	She has a fever.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	279	b "[what]"

ch1_s8_bogdan6_fa421fae		Bogdan puts me on the bed very gently and kneels to take off my shoes.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	291	"[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan6_9161c9b7	d	Bogdan! Stop this!	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	292	d "[what]"

ch1_s8_bogdan6_2f4187d4		Zygmunt looks at the shirtless Bogdan kneeling in front of me and then at my face which is surely beet red. Then he smiles brightly, understanding in his eyes.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	297	"[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan6_82abe01e	z	Well, excuse me then, it looks like you've got the situation under control, Bogdi. I'm going back to my table.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	299	z "[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan6_ae13a5e5	b	Aren't you even a bit worried about her health?!	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	301	b "[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan6_2b389460	z	She's not sick, Bogdan. You're just embarrassing her parading around half-naked. How cute.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	302	z "[what]"

ch1_s8_bogdan6_a9ca9f9a	b	Oh...	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	308	b "[what]"
ch1_s8_bogdan6_eba78287		I hide my face in my hands. This is so embarrassing.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	309	"[what]"

ch1_s8_zygmunt2_3d22b3d2	d	Bets? I don't know about you, but I don't have an awful lot of money.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	353	d "[what]"
ch1_s8_zygmunt2_837af6ee	z	Not that type of bet. Let's say... the person who loses has to grant one wish to the winner.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	354	z "[what]"
ch1_s8_zygmunt2_74e6cf1e		That's dangerous... but exciting nonetheless.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	355	"[what]"
ch1_s8_zygmunt2_185914b4	d	I'd rather play without betting. I don't like this idea.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	361	d "[what]"
ch1_s8_zygmunt2_073c64c8	z	Alright, as you wish.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	363	z "[what]"
ch1_s8_zygmunt2_07c0efe7		We play a few rounds of cards and pass the evening in happy companionship.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	364	"[what]"
ch1_s8_zygmunt2_5fa335fe		Eventually it's time to go to sleep, so we head to our respective rooms.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	365	"[what]"
ch1_s8_zygmunt3_3f321814	d	Alright. Anything?	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	370	d "[what]"
ch1_s8_zygmunt3_136c32e3	z	Yes, anything as long as it's consensual. And nothing big, it should be done in a minute or so and here in the tavern.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	372	z "[what]"
ch1_s8_zygmunt3_09361346		Whoa? I wonder what his wish is. Should I lose on purpose to find out?	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	373	"[what]"
ch1_s8_zygmunt3_6728a10a		No, it would be unlike me to not play to win, and it wouldn't be fair towards Zygmunt either.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	376	"[what]"
ch1_s8_zygmunt3_fa33c3c8		The first two rounds of Leshy we play are a tie. I'm good at Leshy, but clearly Zygmunt is too.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	377	"[what]"
ch1_s8_zygmunt3_5dcebc4b	z	Wow, you are a fierce opponent.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	378	z "[what]"
ch1_s8_zygmunt3_89d721b4	d	So are you.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	379	d "[what]"
ch1_s8_zygmunt3_e9e1b0a1		But with the third game the luck is not on my side and I pull weak cards. I win one round of three but I lose the other two.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	381	"[what]"
ch1_s8_zygmunt3_eefe1c96		I'm too curious about what Zygmunt wants from me. I'm usually super competitive and good at Leshy, but I think I'll play to lose this time around.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	384	"[what]"
ch1_s8_zygmunt3_5ef8c80f		We play three rounds and I win only one of them, not to arouse any suspicion. This makes me the loser.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	385	"[what]"
ch1_s8_zygmunt4_be94b369	d	I lost...	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	390	d "[what]"
ch1_s8_zygmunt4_f0307160	z	Hah. That means I won. Double or nothing?	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	391	z "[what]"
ch1_s8_zygmunt4_fe9c73c1	d	No, it's fine. You're too strong an opponent for me. So, what's your wish?	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	393	d "[what]"
ch1_s8_zygmunt4_fc7ced95		He hesitates for a moment and blushes. Huh? He blushes?	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	395	"[what]"
ch1_s8_zygmunt4_54cdbae6	z	This has to be consensual so you can always say no.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	396	z "[what]"

ch1_s8_zygmunt4_09005a05		Huh?! He wants to kiss me?!	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	400	"[what]"
ch1_s8_zygmunt5_d7b44b66	z	Forget it... that might have been too much to ask...	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	413	z "[what]"
ch1_s8_zygmunt5_b2e82ddd		I get up and go around the table to his side. Then I grab him by the collar of his shirt and kiss him. He is surprised at first but kisses me back.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	417	"[what]"
ch1_s8_zygmunt5_94003b69		Well, I have to say he is good at this. But when he licks my lower lip, asking for permission to deepen the kiss, I pull back. That's too much for my first kiss with him.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	418	"[what]"
ch1_s8_zygmunt5_4ffa0bca		Either way, I enjoyed our moment of intimacy and I don't regret it. I smile at him and he smiles back.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	419	"[what]"
ch1_s8_zygmunt5_f48dd028	z	I didn't expect you would agree to that...	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	420	z "[what]"
ch1_s8_zygmunt5_59fa94f6	d	Then I'm happy to have surprised you.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	421	d "[what]"
ch1_s8_zygmunt5_b4fa4036		We play a few more rounds of cards and pass the evening in happy companionship. Eventually it's time to go to sleep, so we head to our respective rooms.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	422	"[what]"
ch1_s8_zygmunt6_d7b44b66	z	Forget it... that might have been too much to ask...	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	425	z "[what]"
ch1_s8_zygmunt6_86e1802d		I go around the table to his side and lean in front of him. But I kiss him on the cheek. When I pull back he looks surprised and a bit disappointed.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	427	"[what]"
ch1_s8_zygmunt6_fbd5e238	z	That's not what I meant...	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	429	z "[what]"
ch1_s8_zygmunt6_fe1d6ea6	d	You didn't specify where the kiss should be. I believe I upheld my end of the bet.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	431	d "[what]"
ch1_s8_zygmunt6_967bde44	z	Alright. I'll be more precise with my words next time.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	433	z "[what]"

ch1_s8_zygmunt7_f4867b18	d	I think you've got the wrong idea about... us, Zygmunt. I just want to be friends with you.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	439	d "[what]"
ch1_s8_zygmunt7_be907f90	z	Ah... ok. I understand.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	441	z "[what]"
ch1_s8_zygmunt7_6b9b1534		He looks so sad and disappointed that I get up and go over to his side of the table. I lean in and give him a hug.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	442	"[what]"
ch1_s8_zygmunt7_746c1d0a	z	Thank you. I appreciate the consolation prize.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	444	z "[what]"
ch1_s8_zygmunt7_3310f737	d	I'm glad you liked it.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	446	d "[what]"
ch1_s8_zygmunt7_b4fa4036		We play a few more rounds of cards and pass the evening in happy companionship. Eventually it's time to go to sleep, so we head to our respective rooms.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	447	"[what]"
ch1_s8_alone_b36bce4e		I decide to spend my evening doing bard things. After all, everyone needs a bit of time to themselves. So do I.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	456	"[what]"
ch1_s8_alone_a51d5d8d		I sit at my usual spot, tell stories, and play the flute.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	457	"[what]"
ch1_s8_alone_a4bf8e24		Eventually it's time to go to sleep, so I head up to my room.	game/story scripts/ch1.8.rpy	458	"[what]"
ch1_s9_38ad374c		I toss and turn and can't fall asleep. When I do, I dream of combat and scary monsters who used to be human but no longer are.	game/story scripts/ch1.9-10.rpy	6	"[what]"
ch1_s9_1c6ad479	d	No! No!	game/story scripts/ch1.9-10.rpy	7	d "[what]"
ch1_s9_29f4f22c		A knock on the door wakes me up. I get dressed quickly and move to open the door.	game/story scripts/ch1.9-10.rpy	10	"[what]"

ch1_s9_zygmunt2_ff711907	z	We've all been through this... first combat, first kill. It's hard at first... getting used to the brutality of it and to taking the lives of others.	game/story scripts/ch1.9-10.rpy	39	z "[what]"
ch1_s9_zygmunt2_d6b319c3	d	Yes, it's easier for me with the monsters... the undead that are supposed to be dead. I feel like it's a mercy to put those bones to rest.	game/story scripts/ch1.9-10.rpy	40	d "[what]"
ch1_s9_zygmunt2_4e137c6d	d	But when I thought that zombie was a human? I couldn't handle the thought of ending someone else's life. Even though it wouldn't have been by my hand.	game/story scripts/ch1.9-10.rpy	41	d "[what]"

ch1_s9_zygmunt2_dbe8253b	z	As for why we were so quick to try and kill that man before, even before we knew he was an undead... the Green Zmiy bandits are evil bastards who kidnap women and children and sell them to slavers.	game/story scripts/ch1.9-10.rpy	44	z "[what]"
ch1_s9_zygmunt2_dd2a2482	z	It's better to eliminate every one of them. But still, they are human. Even though they lack basic human morals.	game/story scripts/ch1.9-10.rpy	45	z "[what]"

ch1_s9_andia2_18bb7679	a	It's about the fight with the zombie today, isn't it?	game/story scripts/ch1.9-10.rpy	184	a "[what]"
ch1_s9_andia2_92ed1075	d	It is. This was my first fight, the first kill I've witnessed. I guess the brutality of it... is something I have to get used to.	game/story scripts/ch1.9-10.rpy	185	d "[what]"
ch1_s9_andia2_f406e2e6	d	It's easier for me to accept if we are speaking of monsters... the undead that are supposed to be dead. I feel like it's a mercy to put those bones to rest.	game/story scripts/ch1.9-10.rpy	186	d "[what]"
ch1_s9_andia2_ad82e1bc	d	But when I thought that zombie was a human? I almost couldn't handle the thought of ending someone else's life. Even though it wouldn't have been by my hand.	game/story scripts/ch1.9-10.rpy	187	d "[what]"
ch1_s9_andia2_f4d67cde	d	Just standing by while others kill... it's like you've killed too.	game/story scripts/ch1.9-10.rpy	188	d "[what]"
ch1_s9_andia2_07fd3a08	a	It's not the same feeling, but I get what you mean.	game/story scripts/ch1.9-10.rpy	189	a "[what]"
ch1_s9_andia2_bab2c839	a	But the man there... he was a monster too. One of the Green Zmiy bandits who kidnap women and children and sell them to slavers.	game/story scripts/ch1.9-10.rpy	190	a "[what]"
ch1_s9_andia2_87cde3db	d	I see..	game/story scripts/ch1.9-10.rpy	192	d "[what]"
ch1_s9_andia2_5e8aea40	a	It's better to eliminate every one of them. But still, they are human. Even though they lack basic human morals.	game/story scripts/ch1.9-10.rpy	194	a "[what]"
ch1_s9_andia2_826b6531	d	I didn't know they were that evil...	game/story scripts/ch1.9-10.rpy	196	d "[what]"
ch1_s9_andia2_dd488101	a	They are. I don't know if that makes it any easier for you but I hope it does.	game/story scripts/ch1.9-10.rpy	198	a "[what]"
ch1_s9_andia3_466396e1	a	But if you want to quit being an adventurer... after today it would be understandable.	game/story scripts/ch1.9-10.rpy	203	a "[what]"
ch1_s9_andia3_cb50b21d		Do I want to quit the party? Is it too much for me?	game/story scripts/ch1.9-10.rpy	204	"[what]"
ch1_s9_andia4_03ad9222	d	I'm not a quitter. It's too early to give up. I've barely been with you one day.	game/story scripts/ch1.9-10.rpy	213	d "[what]"
ch1_s9_andia4_3dc2d164	a	Okay, but if you ever feel like it's too much for you, let me know.	game/story scripts/ch1.9-10.rpy	214	a "[what]"
ch1_s9_andia4_e6ca8edc	d	I want to spend more time with you... get to know you better, achieve something together.	game/story scripts/ch1.9-10.rpy	215	d "[what]"
ch1_s9_andia4_93f30736	a	That's good. I'd be sad if I had to lose you as a member of our team.	game/story scripts/ch1.9-10.rpy	216	a "[what]"
ch1_s9_andia4_472302dc	a	I hope you'll sleep better now. I'm going back to my room.	game/story scripts/ch1.9-10.rpy	217	a "[what]"
ch1_s9_andia4_0d3d0409	d	Alright. Thank you for talking with me.	game/story scripts/ch1.9-10.rpy	219	d "[what]"

ch1_s9_andia4_a73c5ee0		Andia leaves and I lock the door behind her. It's time to try to sleep again.	game/story scripts/ch1.9-10.rpy	224	"[what]"
ch1_s9_andia4_f8b006c2		I feel lighter now, as if a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I'm glad she understands and acknowledges how I feel.	game/story scripts/ch1.9-10.rpy	225	"[what]"
ending1_6473e9b6	d	I guess that's right. I... I'd like to stop doing this...if you don't mind.	game/story scripts/ch1.9-10.rpy	232	d "[what]"
ending1_e2eacb94	z	Of course I don't. We dragged you into adventuring and you tried. Now you can say that you tried and you don't like it. That's better than having never tried at all.	game/story scripts/ch1.9-10.rpy	235	z "[what]"
ending1_0c567076	b	Don't worry about it, Dobrava! We dragged you into adventuring and you tried. This isn't for everyone and it doesn't have to be for you!	game/story scripts/ch1.9-10.rpy	238	b "[what]"
ending1_82cd3c1a	a	You should first and foremost care about yourself, Dobrava. We dragged you into adventuring and it ended up being not for you. No hard feelings on my part.	game/story scripts/ch1.9-10.rpy	241	a "[what]"
ending1_50acffd6	d	You're right.	game/story scripts/ch1.9-10.rpy	243	d "[what]"
ending1_40a745b0		In the morning I explain the situation to everyone. They are sad, but they let me go.	game/story scripts/ch1.9-10.rpy	257	"[what]"

ch1_s10_76c9ab00		When I fall asleep, I'm inside a strange castle. It's walls, floors, and ceilings are translucent, as if made of glass. But when I touch them they feel solid and sturdy.	game/story scripts/ch1.9-10.rpy	275	"[what]"
ch1_s10_12867007		The castle is very bare-bones, lacking any sort of decorations. Everything is a bit fuzzy to me and I realise I'm dreaming.	game/story scripts/ch1.9-10.rpy	276	"[what]"
ch1_s10_b2d7f654		In front of me on a throne sits a beautiful woman with long, flowing raven-hair. She has a bored expression on her face but when I approach her, she smiles. She smiles, but her eyes remain cold.	game/story scripts/ch1.9-10.rpy	277	"[what]"
ch1_s10_c1369de3	d	Who are you?	game/story scripts/ch1.9-10.rpy	278	d "[what]"

ch1_s10_c6829651		The dream ends and I wake up, hearing a knock on the door. It's Zygmunt calling me for breakfast. I get dressed quickly and come down to the main tavern room.	game/story scripts/ch1.9-10.rpy	281	"[what]"
ch2_s1_b5113327		We all sit in the tavern's dining hall eating eggs with bacon for breakfast.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	17	"[what]"
ch2_s1_5a66479c		The scepter's handle is lying in the middle of the table. We each look at it curiously.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	18	"[what]"
ch2_s1_bd4fac1e	z	There are a few things we need to do today.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	19	z "[what]"
ch2_s1_53138e80	b	No adventuring today?	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	21	b "[what]"
ch2_s1_f0c93ff3	z	No, Bogdi. I think it will be most efficient if we split up.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	22	z "[what]"
ch2_s1_5e916bdf	a	I want to study the handle. I'll take my books on ancient Elven and try to decipher the writing on it as best as I can.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	23	a "[what]"
ch2_s1_26c921f4	z	Alright. Then Bogdi and I will go into town. Bogdan you'll go to talk to the mayor about there being an undead infestation on the road.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	24	z "[what]"
ch2_s1_1e05aa6e	b	Me? Talking? Why not you?	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	26	b "[what]"
ch2_s1_8af25351	z	After the ruckus I've caused in town the past week, I doubt he'll want to see me.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	28	z "[what]"
ch2_s1_297bcb1c	b	Ah... right.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	30	b "[what]"
ch2_s1_520c8898	d	What did you do?	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	32	d "[what]"
ch2_s1_cf39dc70	z	Let the past be the past. I will go to the market to acquire some supplies.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	33	z "[what]"
ch2_s1_39cb1643	z	Dobrava, you can decide what you want to do.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	35	z "[what]"
ch2_s1_daec9ee1	d	I'll stay with Andia.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	41	d "[what]"
ch2_s1_9488dcc0	a	Alright. A second set of eyes will be useful.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	42	a "[what]"
ch2_s1_a6cc4aa8	d	I'll go with Zygmunt and Bogdan.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	46	d "[what]"
ch2_s1_3d2541e6	z	Excellent!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	48	z "[what]"
ch2_s1_1d17f288		We leave Andia in the tavern and go to the market square.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	49	"[what]"
ch2_s1_4903ef9e	d	I'd rather work a bit as a bard, if you don't mind.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	52	d "[what]"

ch2_s1_4666f49b		The guys leave for the town and I watch Andia perform a summoning spell which brings a lot of books to the table.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	60	"[what]"
ch2_s1_832b1acc		I spend the rest of my day singing and telling stories. A crowd quickly gathers around me and I enjoy their attention.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	61	"[what]"
ch2_s2_andia_8ea9deea		The guys leave for the town and I watch Andia cast a spell. Suddenly, piles of books appear on the table next to the scepter's handle.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	72	"[what]"
ch2_s2_andia_c7b8d0a6	d	Whoa! Where did those come from?!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	74	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_andia_4d6732ca	a	I have a pocket space for books so I don't have to carry all of them around myself. This is everything that I own that may be relevant to our scepter.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	75	a "[what]"
ch2_s2_andia_f17814c3	a	This pile is in ancient Elven and modern Elven, so I'll be the one reading it. But that one is in the common tongue. Could you look through it and see if you find anything relevant?	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	76	a "[what]"
ch2_s2_andia_ecda10bc	d	On it!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	78	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_andia_23a2d472		There are three books: {i}History of Ostoya{/i}, {i}Of Elves and Men{/i}, and {i}The Great Exodus of Krasny Ludek{/i}... hmm, the last book sounds like it'll be the least useful, but I'll look through it regardless.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	79	"[what]"
ch2_s2_andia_d16947b5		We spend the next few hours in silence. I take notes on what I think might be relevant to our cause.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	81	"[what]"
ch2_s2_andia_5f939f57		Meanwhile, Andia focuses on translating the ancient Elven engravings on the scepter's handle. She bites her lip and mumbles to herself a lot while doing it.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	82	"[what]"
ch2_s2_andia_1eb1c452	a	This is so frustrating.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	84	a "[what]"
ch2_s2_andia_30c57c8d	"Innkeeper Marysia"	Care for a lunch break, scholars?	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	85	"Innkeeper Marysia" "[what]"
ch2_s2_andia_bdbecc0d	a	No need, we-	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	86	a "[what]"
ch2_s2_andia_a0bf0e92	d	We would very much appreciate having a break with something warm to eat.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	88	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_andia_375f2a6e	a	But we-	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	89	a "[what]"
ch2_s2_andia_88b12cf9	d	The work isn't going to run away, Andia. There's still a lot left to do. We won't complete it today, anyways. Let's enjoy our time together a bit.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	90	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_andia_59e7ad36	a	...Okay, I guess you're right.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	92	a "[what]"
ch2_s2_andia_c0e5dfb8		Marysia serves us warm goulash - just vegetables for Andia and the complete meaty package for me. We dig in. Andia eats like a starving woman and I laugh to myself.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	93	"[what]"
ch2_s2_andia_fa5a3fd9	a	What is it?	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	94	a "[what]"
ch2_s2_andia_a9418cd0	d	You've got some sauce on your chin.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	95	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_andia_5b2806d5	a	Ah, where...	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	96	a "[what]"
ch2_s2_andia_de546966	d	Here we go!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	100	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_andia_679a628b		I wipe it off Andia's face and my fingers linger on her skin a moment longer.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	101	"[what]"
ch2_s2_andia_52a7d0d8	a	Thank you...	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	103	a "[what]"
ch2_s2_andia_a8487d07	d	A bit more to the right!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	106	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_andia_9a0052fe		Andia wipes it off, finding the correct spot.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	107	"[what]"
ch2_s2_andia_6c102ddf	a	Thank you!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	108	a "[what]"
ch2_s2_andia_f1c9244e		I don't care that Andia's face is smeared with sauce, perhaps it'll humble her uptight attitude.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	113	"[what]"
ch2_s2_andia_c5456d6d		As I don't tell Andia where it is, her wiping only makes it worse. The Innkeeper Marysia laughs as she passes by our table.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	114	"[what]"
ch2_s2_andia_830599a2	a	Thank you, Dobrava. Would it have killed you to tell me where the sauce was?	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	116	a "[what]"
ch2_s2_andia_3e369a8c		I just shrug in response.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	117	"[what]"
ch2_s2_andia2_24fcf5e4		After we finish eating, we compile the information we found that might be related to the scepter.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	121	"[what]"
ch2_s2_andia2_f6465ac3		Unfortunately, there isn't much that's relevant. We sigh and return to work.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	122	"[what]"
ch2_s2_boys_36c78f30		The market square is bustling with activity. Today is a market day, so folk from nearby villages have come to sell their produce and crafts.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	139	"[what]"
ch2_s2_boys_e2d49a3e	b	I'm going to visit the mayor then.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	140	b "[what]"
ch2_s2_boys_bacc59f4	d	I'll go with Bogdan to the mayor's.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	145	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_boys_e310981b		I can't help but feel worried about Bogdan speaking to authorities alone. He's not exactly the best conversationalist.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	147	"[what]"
ch2_s2_boys_c3a31464		I doubt he even knows that word. The best "talker".	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	148	"[what]"
ch2_s2_boys_257123a8		Bogdan looks relieved and I can't help but think I made the best decision I could in this situation.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	149	"[what]"
ch2_s2_boys_c2353329	d	I'll shop with Zygmunt then.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	155	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_boys_d5250ea3	z	Great!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	157	z "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_1319e8a8		We leave Zygmunt and make our way through the market to the townhouse where the mayor resides.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	166	"[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_8de28b5d	d	Why didn't Zygmunt go to the mayor instead? Isn't he the face of your group?	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	167	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_59843896	b	{i}Our{/i} group. And yes, he is.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	168	b "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_bde32578	b	But the other day, Zygmunt tried to seduce the mayor's daughter and the mayor got very upset for some reason.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	170	b "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_8477ca67	d	I can't imagine why.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	171	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_820598ba	b	I can't either. The daughter was very willing to go with Zygmunt to the forest and...	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	173	b "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_3552ac69	d	That's too much detail!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	175	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_439b21a0	b	Ahh... what I was trying to say is that it was consensual but the mayor didn't approve. He said something about marriage and now Zygmunt is avoiding him.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	177	b "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_4dc895cd	d	I see.. none of that is very surprising.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	179	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_01ea35ff	d	I guess the conversation with the mayor is on us then.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	182	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_1f15b31e	b	About that... I wouldn't mind if you were the one talking.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	183	b "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_90c020a0	b	I'll treat you to something good later, ok?	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	185	b "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_8fa0ad57		I wanted to be the one talking to the mayor anyways, but I don't mind being bribed either.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	186	"[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_2d1667b9	d	Sure!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	188	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_c1a5598b		We enter the townhouse. There is a stern-looking elven woman with big glasses sitting at a desk before us.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	199	"[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_23722932		Behind her are numerous bookshelves carrying heavy tomes - probably all the accounting one has to do for a town this large. I don't envy this person at all.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	200	"[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_23b7763c	d	We'd like to see the mayor, please!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	202	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_53b2f71d		The secretary adjusts her glasses and looks at me.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	203	"[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_1bce34c9	"Secretary"	An adventurer, yes?	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	204	"Secretary" "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_75f1f53e	d	That's correct!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	205	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_b372546e		Then she looks at Bogdan for a while. I start fidgeting a bit, thinking she might have seen Zygmunt with Bogdan at some point, but she doesn't seem to recognise him.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	206	"[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_472a846c	"Secretary"	You're lucky. The mayor is free right now. Please enter the room on the left.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	207	"Secretary" "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_e81d8ea8	d	Thank you!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	208	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_6518c925		We enter the indicated room and introduce ourselves. The mayor is an old dwarf in expensive but not overly extravagant clothes.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	209	"[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_3242813c		He looks tired, likely from the worry and stress that comes with managing a town.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	210	"[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_8806bda1	d	We're here to let you know about a problem we've encountered while adventuring.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	212	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_14c805a4	"Mayor"	Problems, oh, how I love them... What is it this time?	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	213	"Mayor" "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_fac7937b	d	On the road we encountered one of the Green Zmiy...	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	215	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_f8adb833	"Mayor"	So they're active in the area again. Great.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	216	"Mayor" "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_6a5bab81	d	...But he wasn't actually alive. He was a zombie.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	217	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_5427fbd0	"Mayor"	What? A zombie?! What manner of nonsense are you talking about?!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	218	"Mayor" "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_1c030c73	d	A zombie is a type of undead which...	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	221	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_cc1bff6f	"Mayor"	I know very well what a zombie is! And I know there wouldn't be one without a necromancer around!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	222	"Mayor" "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_98adfe72	d	That's why we...	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	223	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_49594a32	"Mayor"	And we don't have any necromancers in our region! No, we don't! Hiring a group of adventurers capable enough to take care of one would cost the town too much money!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	224	"Mayor" "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_ae03fcde	b	So it's better if you ignore the problem?!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	225	b "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_c6f4aec3	"Mayor"	You insolent youngling...! What are you implying?!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	226	"Mayor" "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_23e2bfe5	b	That you are a-	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	227	b "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_814984cd		I put a hand on Bogdan's arm and squeeze firmly, stopping him from speaking.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	232	"[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_5d37990d	d	Now, now, let's just leave. We've reported the incident to the mayor, so we've done our citizenly obligation.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	234	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_219b2b2f	d	What he does with that information is up to him.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	236	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_5dcecc5e	d	I think you are the insolent one - ignoring good citizens who come to you with real problems!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	240	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_cb99c209	b	I couldn't have said it better myself!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	241	b "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_e411ef32	"Mayor"	You rude adventurers! Leave my office this instant!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	242	"Mayor" "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_4342ba6f	b	-dirty pig!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	245	b "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_9cbb6bbc		I can't help but laugh. That was a... creative way to insult the mayor...	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	247	"[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_caa33d93	"Mayor"	What did you call me?!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	248	"Mayor" "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan_7afa57d1	d	Now, now - there's no need for any of this. We've given our report, let's just leave.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	250	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan2_2b505f19		We take our leave. Back in the market, I can see Bogdan fuming.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	263	"[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan2_bb8f9b15	b	Damn! What a piece of shit!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	264	b "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan2_d5c20008	d	I admit, he's too stingy to take care of the town as he should.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	266	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan2_3cf5f770	d	What are we going to do?	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	267	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan2_811a709c	b	As strong as the party's become after you joined Dobrava, I'm not confident we can defeat a necromancer with just the four of us.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	268	b "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan2_af4bf8ae	b	I could ask my mother for help but... I've never done that. I don't want to show weakness.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	269	b "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan2_ef5785be	d	It's not a weakness to ask for the help of others!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	271	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan2_47999777	b	I guess... it will take mother two weeks to come here from the border anyways. Do we have that much time?	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	273	b "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan2_1575c75c	d	We might not. I guess it's on us to protect the town then?	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	275	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan2_b117d687	b	It might as well be! And we will protect it!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	277	b "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan2_b49fbc7f		I look around for something to cheer Bogdan up. There's a stall with fried chicken, one with cotton candy, and one with healthy vegetables.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	279	"[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan2_4e98f7bc	d	Bogdi!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	281	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan2_59851ddd	b	What is it, Dobrava?	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	283	b "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan2_57e38882		What should we eat?	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	284	"[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan2_a840a12d	d	You said you would treat me to something good after the meeting! Let's eat some chicken wings!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	288	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan2_cbdd63a0	b	Oh... chicken! I love chicken! Except for kurolishek, the undead kind!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	290	b "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan2_22b4719a		Well, undead chickens are definitely problematic, as is everything else that's undead.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	291	"[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan2_d562037f		We buy one chicken wing for me and way too many for Bogdan before we sit by the fountain.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	292	"[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan2_e4845d58		I bet Bogdi likes cotton candy.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	296	"[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan2_40cf689a	d	You said you would treat me to something good after the meeting! Let's get some cotton candy!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	297	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan2_4f20639c	b	Oh... cotton candy! I love sweet things! kittens, doggies, baby chickens...	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	299	b "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan2_d32acb3c	d	But you don't eat those, do you?	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	300	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan2_54afc056	b	Of course not! But cotton candy? Give me some of that!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	301	b "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan2_865a7491		We buy one cotton candy for each of us and sit by the fountain.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	302	"[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan2_528b558f	d	You said you would treat me to something good after the meeting! Let's eat some healthy vegetables!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	306	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan2_9136f4fe	b	Is that broccoli...?	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	308	b "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan2_49763227	d	Yes! Broccoli is a gift from the gods!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	309	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan2_7bf11b11	b	I will eat it with you... I guess...	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	310	b "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan2_653fa78a		We buy some fried vegetables for both of us and sit by the fountain.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	311	"[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan3_cb1f0936		We spend the next hour eating and commenting on the well-to-do townspeoples' weird manner of dress.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	317	"[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan3_6b8e90cf	d	What does she have on her head? Is that a peacock feather?!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	319	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan3_78fb5643	b	Look at that man's breaches! They're so low they are about to fall down!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	321	b "[what]"
ch2_s2_bogdan3_c2a4c368		It's really comfortable being around Bogdan. I can't help but enjoy our time together.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	323	"[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt_1f132902		Bogdan leaves for the mayor's house located in one of the corners of the square. He quickly disappears from our sight.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	334	"[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt_d37f5419	d	There really are a lot of people here. We could get separated easily.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	335	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt_b231f4be	z	About that... I have a proposal for you. We can either do this the proper way or the fun way.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	336	z "[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt_2c3a63c7	d	What do you mean?	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	338	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt_b847a9cc	z	For the proper way, we can hold hands, going from stall to stall and buying everything we need.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	340	z "[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt_f9f08e2c	z	Or, the fun way, I can show you a few tricks and we can save some money.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	342	z "[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt_300c29ea	d	Wait, you don't mean... stealing?	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	343	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt_7ae9a9dc	z	Stealing? Gods no! I call it "acquiring things".	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	345	z "[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt_64e06ae8	d	It's still stealing, no matter what you call it.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	346	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt_4de4e10e	z	Tomato, tomato. Which will it be?	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	348	z "[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt2_435b7b98	d	The proper way of course. I'm no thief.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	364	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt2_790ba13a	z	Ah... the boring way then. At least I get to hold hands with you.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	366	z "[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt2_d84ad0e4		Should we? I guess it {i}would{/i} be a pain in the ass if we end up separated...	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	367	"[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt2_726fcf20		I grab Zygmunt's hand and he intertwines his fingers with mine. His hand is bigger than mine and feels strong - rough and calloused from years plucking a bowstring.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	371	"[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt2_30671c36		Zygmunt pulls out a list from his pocket. I look at it and I see very proper Elven handwriting. Andia probably wrote this while I was still sleeping.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	372	"[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt2_9b239879	z	Alright first... exchanging the old Elven coin at the antiquities shop.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	373	z "[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt2_e23d2c92		We spend over an hour moving from shop to shop, trying to negotiate the best prices. Between the two of us-both well-spoken and articulate-we manage to get good deals. All while we hold hands.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	374	"[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt2_7eba496f	z	Good job, partner!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	376	z "[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt2_d6ef440a	d	You too!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	378	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt2_b52043cd		After a job well done, we go back to the tavern.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	379	"[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt3_3236a8cb	d	Alright. I hope I won't regret this. Let's do it the fun way.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	384	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt3_e1a75c27	z	Yay! I knew you didn't have a stick up your ass! Let's go, partner!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	386	z "[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt3_62e29b21		First, Zygmunt shows me how to pickpocket people. I watch him move around the crowd fluidly and cut off people's coin pouches without them noticing anything.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	387	"[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt3_beb5a363		Then he tells me to try it myself. He picks what he calls an easy target for me-an old, sweating merchant. As I get close to him I almost faint from the foul smell. But I succeed. His pouch is mine.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	388	"[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt3_932c5ef1	d	I did it!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	390	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt3_f3f59f16		I exclaim in a back alley, showing my spoils to Zygmunt.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	391	"[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt3_31293624	z	Indeed you did.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	392	z "[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt3_632d1d50		He looks happy and proud of me. I feel a sense of accomplishment.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	393	"[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt3_a5200319	z	Next is stealing things from stalls. Let's start with the classic: apples.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	394	z "[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt3_e452ac9b		But as we move closer to the apple stalls, we hear yelling from the crowd.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	395	"[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt3_e95e1418	"Merchant"	Thief! I've been robbed!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	396	"Merchant" "[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt3_f2c8d7f3		It's the merchant I pickpocketed earlier. Zygmunt grabs my hand.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	397	"[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt3_30eb6e8c	z	They haven't realised it's us yet so let's get out of here. Walk like a normal person leaving a market and don't look so frightened.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	399	z "[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt3_8d25a15e		I school in my expression as best as I can and we leave the market before the guards come out to close it and interrogate everyone.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	400	"[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt4_57e816ab	d	It will be more efficient if we each take half the items on the list and shop separately.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	405	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt4_393a6218	z	Efficient? Maybe... but will it be fun? No.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	407	z "[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt4_668d6bbe	d	It's just shopping. It doesn't need to be fun.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	408	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt4_1392853e	z	Shopping can be fun too. But as you wish.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	410	z "[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt4_e71f5adb		We go our separate ways and I buy the things I have on my half of the list. But as I move closer to the produce stalls, I hear yelling from the crowd.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	411	"[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt4_e95e1418	"Merchant"	Thief! I've been robbed!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	412	"Merchant" "[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt4_8b558401		What is going on? I see Zygmunt walking out of the plaza like nothing happened. No one is looking at him, everyone is focused on the man screaming.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	414	"[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt4_803885ce		Did he... oh, I hope he didn't!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	415	"[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt4_08f9fa52		I school my expression as best I can and leave the market in the same direction as Zygmunt before the guards come to interrogate everyone.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	416	"[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt4_34ca2c2e		I catch up with Zygmunt on the road to the tavern.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	417	"[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt4_25166987	z	Is everything alright, Dobrava?	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	418	z "[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt4_96dd1bcf		I say nothing to him.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	419	"[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt5_c17737d8		We meet with Bogdan outside of town, just down the road from the tavern where we have been staying.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	435	"[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt5_9619652f	b	Is everything okay? Where are the supplies?	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	437	b "[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt5_4d6f7b7d	z	Ah... we'll have to ask you to go buy things in our stead... with this money.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	438	z "[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt5_81b0aa09	d	So you've bought nothing?	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	442	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt5_afcc56cf		He throws the pouches he's "acquired" at Bogdan. Bogdan catches them but looks as displeased as I do.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	443	"[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt5_3bde27b0		He throws the pouches we've "acquired" at Bogdan. Bogdan catches them but looks displeased.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	445	"[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt5_2fd88f7c	b	You've stolen again, Zygmunt!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	447	b "[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt5_9ec1c3de	z	Not so loud, Bogdan!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	449	z "[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt5_63799abc	b	You said you would stop with your thieving ways. And you! Dobrava! Why did you not stop him?!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	450	b "[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt5_b95efa92	d	I...	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	452	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt5_17483047	b	Or did you help too?	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	453	b "[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt5_dc3b9bfa	d	I did but...	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	455	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt5_dae2ad8f	d	I didn't, we were shopping separately. I would have stopped him if I suspected this would happen.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	457	d "[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt5_cafec3a6	b	Oh gods, Zygmunt, you stupid bastard!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	458	b "[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt5_9abcfcc6		Bogdan grabs Zygmunt by the collar and punches him in the face. Zygmunt doesn't even try to dodge.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	463	"[what]" with sshake
ch2_s2_zygmunt5_66df0c24	z	I deserved that.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	465	z "[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt5_8b69155b	b	Good. Now don't do it again.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	466	b "[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt5_baff4e49	b	I'm going to town to do your job. Just go back to the tavern.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	468	b "[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt5_7c477663		He takes the money and the Elven coin we have to exchange and goes back to town.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	469	"[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt5_a5c5e398		I feel guilty about what we did and from the look on his face, so does Zygmunt. We return to the tavern.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	471	"[what]"
ch2_s2_zygmunt5_c6b6791e		I feel angry at Zygmunt for what he did but I see he regrets it, so I calm down. We return to the tavern.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	473	"[what]"
ch2_s3_0db6cf0f		By the time each of our tasks are complete, it's evening. We gather together at our table where the scepter's handle lays in the middle on the blessed cloth.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	494	"[what]"
ch2_s3_07a4ae37	z	Have you made any progress, Andia?	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	495	z "[what]"
ch2_s3_5518721a	a	...no, I hate to say it but I have not. I managed to decipher some of the words on the handle, but the rest remain a mystery.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	496	a "[what]"
ch2_s3_6b14004d	z	What do you have to say for yourself, Dobrava? You distracted her.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	499	z "[what]"
ch2_s3_5f7ad7ae	d	What? I did not! I was helping!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	501	d "[what]"
ch2_s3_821c2b2f	a	She was. Leave her alone.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	503	a "[what]"
ch2_s3_9655157d	z	I was just kidding. It's all good.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	504	z "[what]"
ch2_s3_0484995f		Andia sighs.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	505	"[what]"
ch2_s3_9dde4d26	a	'Light', 'darkness', 'defeat'. Those words don't form a coherent narrative for me. I don't know what the creators of this artifact were trying to say.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	509	a "[what]"
ch2_s3_0a0f9ff2	a	I need more time, but I'm sure I will figure this out.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	511	a "[what]"
ch2_s3_77604f27	z	Take all the time you need.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	512	z "[what]"
ch2_s3_1daf8fac	z	Well, it's been a long day. We've spent enough time together I think. Time to go to your rooms and sleep. I want you all well-rested for tomorrow!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	514	z "[what]"
ch2_s3_8c816e1e	d	Yes, momma bear!	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	516	d "[what]"
ch2_s3_e0356e58	z	What did you call your leader?	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	518	z "[what]"
ch2_s3_20b97f27		Zygmunt smacks me playfully on the hand as I get up and run upstairs.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	519	"[what]"
ch2_s3_d4a92e4d		Indeed, I'm very tired after today. But the most important thing is that it was fun.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	520	"[what]"
ch2_s4_8e2b4c14		I fall asleep much easier tonight.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	528	"[what]"
ch2_s4_7cbb2696		However, I'm surprised to see the same castle as the night before.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	532	"[what]"
ch2_s4_35b2e266		I walk its hallways and look in the empty rooms. Eventually, I reach the throne room again.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	533	"[what]"
ch2_s4_86fb890b		This time around everything is more detailed, more decorated. As if the dream is a little more real.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	534	"[what]"
ch2_s4_8f56d197		It's still a bit hazy, as if I'm walking in fog, but it looks like a proper castle now.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	535	"[what]"
ch2_s4_60c19e49		However, it's still devoid of life, barring the beautiful raven-haired woman sitting on the throne. She looks so bored there. I guess I would be too if I had no one to talk to and nothing to do.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	539	"[what]"
ch2_s4_a96c321e	d	Hello?	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	540	d "[what]"
ch2_s4_2768a104		I walk closer to her and call out, but I don't expect an answer. I'm surprised when I get one.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	543	"[what]"
ch2_s4_cbf6c99f		I don't approach her, but call out. I don't expect an answer. I'm surprised when I get one.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	546	"[what]"
ch2_s4_2_3439cbdc	"???"	Songbird.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	550	"???" "[what]"
ch2_s4_2_2bfa556c	d	Songbird?	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	552	d "[what]"
ch2_s4_2_d84c9d43		I look around but see no birds here.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	553	"[what]"
ch2_s4_2_d86edc16	d	Do you mean me? Because I'm a bard?	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	554	d "[what]"
ch2_s4_2_46bf9a91		She nods and smiles. Again, she smiles but her eyes remain cold.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	556	"[what]"
ch2_s4_2_efa7f074		I'm seriously creeped out here. When I try to ask her to stop smiling like that, I wake up, covered in cold sweat again.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	558	"[what]"
ch2_s4_2_1636b022		It's morning. Time to wash up, get dressed, and start the day.	game/story scripts/ch2.rpy	560	"[what]"
ch3_s1_923934c9		It's breakfast again. All four of us sit around the table, munching on some toast with jam while the scepter's handle lies in the middle. I stare at it intently as if that would change anything.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	16	"[what]"
ch3_s1_728d77cb	a	Dobrava, you're going to burn a hole into it with your stare.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	18	a "[what]"
ch3_s1_074da15c		I ignore her joke. There's one thing we haven't tried yet. The others fear it's cursed, but it doesn't seem that way.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	19	"[what]"
ch3_s1_da7fec03		Before anyone can stop me, I move quickly and touch the handle.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	23	"[what]"
ch3_s1_7c2464f3	b	Dobrava!	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	24	b "[what]"
ch3_s1_4ceba5ab	z	No, don't touch it!	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	25	z "[what]"
ch3_s1_379ff23a	a	What are you doing?!	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	26	a "[what]"
ch3_s1_a2b386ec		Despite their worries, nothing bad happens. I don't feel my energy being drained or a weight on my shoulders trying to drag me down to the underworld.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	27	"[what]"
ch3_s1_c27d3330	d	Folks, calm down. It's not cursed.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	29	d "[what]"

ch3_s1_4bb54acf	d	Hey, no risk, no fun. Have you not learned that from Zygmunt?	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	31	d "[what]"
ch3_s1_88d3c95a	z	Don't drag me into this!	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	33	z "[what]"
ch3_s1_f145585d		I focus on the handle again. There is one weird thing about it.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	37	"[what]"
ch3_s1_3fc2ea0e	d	I feel like it's trying to pull me somewhere. Like I should hold it in my hand and let it guide me.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	39	d "[what]"
ch3_s1_08eb5426	b	So it's cursed after all.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	41	b "[what]"
ch3_s1_785ae5e5	d	I don't think so, its energy feels clear.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	42	d "[what]"
ch3_s1_bc713ab7		Andia puts her hand on the handle too.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	43	"[what]"
ch3_s1_82e11952	a	Hmm... yes, the energy feels clear and light. But I don't feel it pulling me anywhere.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	44	a "[what]"
ch3_s1_3873cc23	d	I'm not lying!	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	45	d "[what]"
ch3_s1_f4cc1734	a	I'm not saying you are. You might be more susceptible to this kind of energy than I am. That's why you feel the pull while I don't.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	46	a "[what]"
ch3_s1_f715b250	d	Well it clearly wants me to go somewhere... should we listen to it?	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	47	d "[what]"
ch3_s1_9fb2a5c9	z	Hmm... I'm curious where it'll lead us.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	48	z "[what]"

ch3_s1_d731c915		With the scepter's handle in hand we leave for the place it is leading us to.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	56	"[what]"
ch3_s1_3e7e4a50		Wherever that is...	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	57	"[what]"
ch3_s2_0e52b93a		Everyone is abnormally quiet and on edge today. They all walk apart from each other.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	72	"[what]"
ch3_s2_2deec231		Whom should I approach?	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	73	"[what]"
ch3_s2_246e39a7		I shouldn't bother anyone with idle chatter. If they don't want to talk, there's no point in trying to engage them in conversation.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	86	"[what]"
ch3_s2_edd9541a		It's a bit lonely to walk in silence, but we {i}are{/i} on a mission. So, we continue walking to wherever the handle is guiding me.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	87	"[what]"
ch3_s2_zygmunt_12b5e5d5		I walk over to Zygmunt. He looks as if he's deep in thought, so unlike him.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	93	"[what]"

ch3_s2_zygmunt_2d2d4900		Oh no, why did I ask that? He looks at me surprised.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	100	"[what]"
ch3_s2_zygmunt_423cecad	d	That got your attention, didn't it?	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	101	d "[what]"
ch3_s2_zygmunt_a68d8082		Let's cover this up. It's not like I'd really like to know or anything.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	102	"[what]"
ch3_s2_zygmunt_e9b5ee6b	z	Just one boyfriend. Or rather, fiance. We were engaged in front of the gods.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	104	z "[what]"
ch3_s2_zygmunt_4e452bbd	d	Oh...	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	106	d "[what]"

ch3_s2_zygmunt_c701d93e		We continue talking about lighter topics while we follow the handle's pull towards the unknown.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	115	"[what]"
ch3_s2_zygmunt2_6d888db7	d	...Why did you break up?	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	119	d "[what]"
ch3_s2_zygmunt2_5101bc09		Wait... what if they didn't break up? Is he still in a relationship?	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	120	"[what]"
ch3_s2_zygmunt2_e77fd477		But he asked me for a kiss the other night!	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	122	"[what]"
ch3_s2_zygmunt2_20b43a7b		And we held hands while shopping... to not get separated, but still. It counts!	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	125	"[what]"
ch3_s2_zygmunt2_0c9afd2c		And we stole things together - we're partners in crime. That means we're close, right?	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	127	"[what]"
ch3_s2_zygmunt2_c1ad7ca4		As his friend, I feel like I should know!	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	129	"[what]"

ch3_s2_zygmunt2_d9cd4cd7	z	I sleep around to try and satisfy my need for intimacy, but of course it doesn't work.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	135	z "[what]"

ch3_s2_zygmunt2_adb4c814		How do I feel about Zygmunt?	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	137	"[what]"
ch3_s2_zygmunt2_a20c3ea7	d	I won't say I shouldn't have asked. I consider you a friend and as such, I think I should know these things.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	142	d "[what]"
ch3_s2_zygmunt2_504223c9	z	I'm happy to be considered your friend.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	143	z "[what]"
ch3_s2_zygmunt2_03d7719e	d	Of course you are, silly.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	144	d "[what]"
ch3_s2_zygmunt2_c701d93e		We continue talking about lighter topics while we follow the handle's pull towards the unknown.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	145	"[what]"
ch3_s2_zygmunt3_11945fe4		He continues as if he's not listening to me at all..	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	154	"[what]"
ch3_s2_zygmunt3_289f6a70	z	I've given up on relationships... but have I really?	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	155	z "[what]"

ch3_s2_zygmunt3_5ec4777c	z	Why?	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	159	z "[what]"
ch3_s2_zygmunt3_dfc11aae	d	Because I... I might be interested in something like that with you.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	161	d "[what]"
ch3_s2_zygmunt3_212dc01f	d	I-I know it's a bit early t-to talk about things like that. We've only m-met the day before yesterday...	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	162	d "[what]"
ch3_s2_zygmunt3_fef4f436	z	You're stuttering. How cute.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	164	z "[what]"
ch3_s2_zygmunt3_1837d458	d	It's not cute!	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	165	d "[what]"

ch3_s2_zygmunt3_13b6d5c9		He stops walking and I stop too. He bends down a bit to put his face at the same height as mine.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	167	"[what]"
ch3_s2_zygmunt3_d627fa4b	z	See? Something's pulling me towards you.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	168	z "[what]"
ch3_s2_zygmunt3_e061ff94		And he kisses me firmly on the lips. The kiss quickly turns passionate and we get lost in each other's taste.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	169	"[what]"
ch3_s2_zygmunt3_a67e4ef8		We are interrupted by the sounds of clapping and cat-calling. I push Zygmunt away and he pouts.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	170	"[what]"

ch3_s2_zygmunt3_1e96e0c9		This is embarrassing but makes me giddy with joy too even though his tone is mocking and I know he is not serious. All this means is that we want to try being exclusive. I take his hand in my own.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	193	"[what]"
ch3_s2_zygmunt3_5eed07bb	d	Yes, I would.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	194	d "[what]"

ch3_s2_andia2_c53a834d		We are interrupted by the sounds of clapping and cat-calling from the direction we were walking in.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	354	"[what]"
ch3_s2_andia2_a77f1137	b	Woohoo! Don't mind us. Keep going!	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	355	b "[what]"
ch3_s2_andia2_5a9a38db	z	Go Andia, go! You couldn't have picked better!	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	356	z "[what]"
ch3_s2_andia2_d0a23a64		I take Andia's hand in mine and we smile softly at each other. We walk hand in hand, joining the others.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	357	"[what]"
ch3_s3_09760f9e		Eventually, we reach another Elven ruin. We explore the various chambers fighting skeletons. I buff the party and everything goes smoothly.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	389	"[what]"
ch3_s3_12e5270f		In the ruin's final room is a skeleton with a giant sword guarding a chest.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	390	"[what]"
ch3_s3_92819360	d	The handle is pulling towards the chest.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	391	d "[what]"
ch3_s3_da1f4e2f	b	Then let's fight this thing!	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	393	b "[what]"
ch3_s3_2e587e0e		We engage the skeleton in combat. I buff the party but the skeleton is a strong opponent, its bones sturdy and well-connected.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	394	"[what]"
ch3_s3_de79b9d0		At one point, the skeleton injures Bogdan and I play the song of healing. Bogdan's wound closes.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	396	"[what]"
ch3_s3_8caab823	b	Thank you, Dobrava! Now let's finish this!	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	397	b "[what]"
ch3_s3_af117691		With a final swing of his sword, Bogdan destroys the skeleton. Its bones shatter on the ground. Bogdan approaches the chest-	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	398	"[what]"
ch3_s3_f683642c	z	Wait, let me check for traps!	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	400	z "[what]"
ch3_s3_3f313735		Bogdan stops with his hand still in the air. Zygmunt approaches the chest and pokes at it with his thieves' tools.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	402	"[what]"
ch3_s3_55b89377	z	A-ha! There was a trap! And... now it's disarmed!	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	404	z "[what]"
ch3_s3_4183cb88		Disarming traps is just like Andia's magic: completely over my head. But I trust Zygmunt if he says it's safe.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	405	"[what]"
ch3_s3_944486c3	d	Open it.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	406	d "[what]"
ch3_s3_d68c9174		Zygmunt opens the chest with a look of anticipation, but his expression quickly changes to one of disappointment.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	407	"[what]"
ch3_s3_423946dc	z	What is this trash?!	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	411	z "[what]"
ch3_s3_deda83fb		I look over his shoulder. What looks like another part of the scepter's handle lies inside, but the indent where a jewel would sit is empty. It's adorned with Elven markings.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	412	"[what]"
ch3_s3_84b58dc1		I feel a sense of accomplishment for finding this, but the feeling is not my own. The handle, somehow, looks incredibly pleased with itself	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	413	"[what]"
ch3_s3_cb5c36c5	d	This is it. This is what the handle wanted me to find.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	414	d "[what]"
ch3_s3_92a01744	z	But this is just a piece of trash!	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	416	z "[what]"
ch3_s3_bc1ee782	a	Don't be rash and jump to conclusions. It has the same markings as the other part. If we put them together, we only need to find the jewel and the scepter will be complete.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	418	a "[what]"
ch3_s3_a39fc54c	b	And then what?	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	421	b "[what]"
ch3_s3_03778751	a	That's a good question. I hope the Elven language on this piece will bring us closer to determining the scepter's purpose. 	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	423	a "[what]"
ch3_s3_fa40e496	d	Fingers crossed.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	425	d "[what]"
ch3_s3_5691ac19	z	There's a pouch with a handful of ancient Elven coins too. That should pay for a week's room and board. At least if the scepter turns out to be a dud this excursion wasn't {i}entirely{/i} pointless.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	426	z "[what]"
ch3_s3_941118bc	d	Don't say that. It's never pointless to adventure together.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	428	d "[what]"
ch3_s3_cedd8187	b	I agree with Dobrava. Adventuring is all that matters.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	430	b "[what]"
ch3_s3_c8eb4a59	a	And gaining knowledge.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	432	a "[what]"
ch3_s3_b541d8c2	z	You folks are hopeless. Am I the only one who worries about getting enough money to eat and sleep?	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	434	z "[what]"
ch3_s3_b3409a1e		We laugh at that. Taking the new part of the scepter in hand, we try to fit it together with the one we already had. It fits without a problem.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	435	"[what]"
ch3_s3_9867a306		Andia packs it in her pouch and we start our trip back to the tavern.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	436	"[what]"
ch3_s4_2fa8403a	d	I can't help but wonder why the scepter wants us to gather all of its parts.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	467	d "[what]"
ch3_s4_3f58830e	a	I guess every item wants to be complete. There is beauty in completeness.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	468	a "[what]"
ch3_s4_2785305f	z	Academic bullshit. I agree with Dobrava - it feels fishy.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	469	z "[what]"
ch3_s4_6b19b2cb	b	Are we having fish for dinner today? I like fish!	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	471	b "[what]"
ch3_s4_1d6e8762		Zygmunt facepalms. Andia and I snicker.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	472	"[what]"
ch3_s4_672ef459	d	If it's available at the tavern, why not?	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	474	d "[what]"
ch3_s4_5ce79dc9		We continue our conversation while continuing towards the tavern. We are all in high spirits, albeit tired.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	475	"[what]"
ch3_s4_cb8e2bbf		I can't help but feel like something bad is going to happen, but I don't know what. How do I stop something like that?	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	476	"[what]"
ch3_s4_fa4697c0	"Leshy"	You can't stop fate.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	479	"Leshy" "[what]"
ch3_s4_d4fbc3b8		We all stop walking. Suddenly in the forest to the left there is a figure where none was before.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	484	"[what]"
ch3_s4_8c372a7e	a	Leshy! Guardian of the Forest!	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	485	a "[what]"
ch3_s4_76ae9d3f		We all bow in reverence of the figure of wisdom and the protector of everything living in the forests of Ostoya.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	490	"[what]"
ch3_s4_e9c3c0f6	z	To what do we owe the pleasure, Ancient One?	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	491	z "[what]"
ch3_s4_9d7be216	"Leshy"	You are in possession of the Scepter of Light. You should collect the last piece. It has chosen you to defeat it's archenemy.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	492	"Leshy" "[what]"
ch3_s4_88ed5157	d	We were chosen?	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	494	d "[what]"
ch3_s4_a433a029	"Leshy"	Yes, you were. Some time ago, a wizardess named Yarlomila turned away from the light. She experimented with death and sacrificed many in search of immortality.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	495	"Leshy" "[what]"
ch3_s4_9aedae21	"Leshy"	But all she found was sadness and loneliness. Now she seeks revenge on the world for making her an outcast. She creates undead and uses them to harm the people of Ostoya.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	497	"Leshy" "[what]"
ch3_s4_31e5db2d	"Leshy"	Only the Scepter of Light can stop her.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	498	"Leshy" "[what]"
ch3_s4_0f9fea76	z	Thank you, Ancient One for setting us on this quest. We will defeat the evil wizardess.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	499	z "[what]"
ch3_s4_d0e40f42	b	You can count on us. We are capable warriors.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	500	b "[what]"
ch3_s4_31b141d6	a	May your knowledge guide us.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	501	a "[what]"
ch3_s4_1523fe20	d	...	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	502	d "[what]"
ch3_s4_231c5c47		Wait... Leshy said this wizardess is doing those things because she is sad and lonely. Maybe she can be reasoned with. Why is everyone so quick to attack her?	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	503	"[what]"
ch3_s4_8d22314a	"Leshy"	May the blessings of the forest light your path.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	504	"Leshy" "[what]"
ch3_s4_2dc6cdec		We all thank Leshy for their blessing. Then, in the same manner they appeared out of nowhere, between one blink of our eyes and the other, they disappear from sight.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	505	"[what]"
ch3_s4_f15c6d60	d	I can't help but feel sad for this wizardess...	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	509	d "[what]"
ch3_s4_35ba70ca	b	What?	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	513	b "[what]"
ch3_s4_ef914a2c	a	What do you mean, Dobrava?	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	514	a "[what]"
ch3_s4_120fb7f1	a	You are aware that the undead we've been fighting the past few days were likely created by this Yarlomila?	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	518	a "[what]"
ch3_s4_97b5cbb2	d	That's... probably true. So she's out to destroy Priporovy Forest and the people living near it?	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	520	d "[what]"
ch3_s4_edf00f1c	a	That would be my guess.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	522	a "[what]"
ch3_s4_a68346b4	z	She is an evil necromancer, Dobrava. She must be defeated! If she isn't, think of the harm and destruction she could cause!	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	524	z "[what]"
ch3_s4_4570ae65	d	Well, yes, I know she must be stopped one way or another. But maybe we could try talking with her?	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	526	d "[what]"
ch3_s4_31882154		They all look at each other. Finally Zygmunt sighs.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	528	"[what]"
ch3_s4_75e861eb	z	You're too kind, Dobrava... Very well, we will try talking to her before we engage in a fight.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	529	z "[what]"
ch3_s4_be4f984c	d	Thank you, that's all I ask.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	531	d "[what]"
ch3_s4_0832e7f8		I feel a bit better with the reassurance that we won't fight without reason. We continue on the road to the tavern.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	532	"[what]"
ch3_s5_e37c767d		Upon reaching the tavern we are dead tired, so after eating dinner we decide to call it a day.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	541	"[what]"
ch3_s5_a0b3bea7		I can't help but think of the evil wizardess Yarlomila, but I'm ready to fall asleep as soon as my head hits the pillow.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	543	"[what]"
ch3_s5_0791276d		Too much has happened in the past few days and I'm not used to the stress. I hope my companions can be talked into having a day off tomorrow.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	544	"[what]"
ch3_s5_9176b2d8		I give in to my tiredness.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	545	"[what]"
ch3_s5_6d10c2cd		I'm in the same glass castle as I was the previous two nights. Without delay, I make my way to the throne room to meet the beautiful woman. Maybe tonight I can engage her in a proper conversation.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	552	"[what]"
ch3_s5_259a6b79		The only thing that changed in the throne room is the fact that there is now a large golden birdcage in there.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	553	"[what]"
ch3_s5_a95a2f13		I briefly wonder what kind of bird such a large cage could be for? I can only think of the mythical phoenix.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	554	"[what]"
ch3_s5_f77a231c		I focus on the woman's expression as I approach her. She looks so sad and lonely. I can't leave her like this!	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	558	"[what]"
ch3_s5_6a956ad1		I come closer to the throne than ever and stand in front of the woman.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	559	"[what]"
ch3_s5_e0c6a1c7		Without hesitation, I take her hand in mine.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	562	"[what]"
ch3_s5_7d28ee05	d	Why do you look so lonely?	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	566	d "[what]"
ch3_s5_5855be63		She doesn't reply but instead grabs my hand.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	567	"[what]"
ch3_s5_11efeea0		We stare each other in the eyes for a moment before she grabs my hand.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	570	"[what]"
ch3_s5_2_a893b625		She smiles her creepy smile which doesn't reach her eyes. Her hand is very cold, but I don't pull away. Maybe I can have some sort of connection with her this way? Reach her?	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	575	"[what]"
ch3_s5_2_b79539ab		Before I know it, she teleports to the cage and pushes me inside. The door closes behind me with a loud bang and the lock clicks. The woman laughs.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	577	"[what]"
ch3_s5_2_7c8df067	"???"	My precious Songbird. Now you are mine.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	580	"???" "[what]"
ch3_s5_2_acd73116	d	What are you doing?! Who are you?!	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	581	d "[what]"
ch3_s5_2_7724e60e	y	They call me Yarlomila.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	582	y "[what]"
ch3_s5_2_c29c4033	d	The necromancer?!	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	583	d "[what]"
ch3_s5_2_cd798302	y	The very same.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	584	y "[what]"
ch3_s5_2_efec842a		The one Leshy told us about! The evil wizardess!	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	585	"[what]"
ch3_s5_2_c0b73772	d	Let me out!	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	587	d "[what]"
ch3_s5_2_29e7ef7d	y	I have no intention to.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	588	y "[what]"
ch3_s5_2_9a11406b	d	I want to wake up!	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	589	d "[what]"
ch3_s5_2_7aed5957		I pinch myself but nothing happens.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	590	"[what]"
ch3_s5_2_8fbdbee1	y	Oh, do you think this is a dream? It is not. You are in my domain.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	591	y "[what]"
ch3_s5_2_ef5f3e51	d	What? Where are we?	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	592	d "[what]"
ch3_s5_2_083da3ac	y	Somewhere we will never be found.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	593	y "[what]"
ch3_s5_2_20b442c5	d	That's not true! My friends will come for me!	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	594	d "[what]"
ch3_s5_2_c1b7d889	y	Oh, they can try. But they can't reach this place.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	595	y "[what]"
ch3_s5_2_e8acc125	y	Now sing for me, Songbird.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	596	y "[what]"
ch3_s5_2_b60d44d9	d	What? No way! I won't!	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	597	d "[what]"
ch3_s5_2_592d14e1	y	One day you will.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	598	y "[what]"
ch3_s5_2_9592a857		I look past Yarlomila, averting her gaze. I'm angry at her. I notice a glowing object on the throne. A yellow jewel is there, shining brightly.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	599	"[what]"
ch3_s5_2_23cf2e6d		I feel a sense of familiarity from this object. Is that the last piece of the scepter? Then, maybe the pull can direct the party to me... but wasn't I the only one who felt the pull?!	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	600	"[what]"
ch3_s5_2_ff6b7b4d		Ahh... this is so complicated. How did it come to this?!	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	601	"[what]"
ch3_s5_2_a8c0137c		Nevermind, the "how" isn't as important as the "what next?". Right now, I have to focus on my survival and hope for the best.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	602	"[what]"
ch3_s5_2_1b902c44		But Yarlomila? She makes me so angry. Who in their right mind would imprison another person in a birdcage and call them a songbird?! Despicable.	game/story scripts/ch3.rpy	603	"[what]"
ch4_s1_3ea9acfa		Several days pass. I don't feel the need to eat or sleep. It's like I've been frozen in time alongside everything else.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	11	"[what]"
ch4_s1_d910189c		Occasionally, Yarlomila's zombie servants bring her fresh piles of bones from some poor souls whose graves have been desecrated.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	12	"[what]"
ch4_s1_5994468f		She places the souls of the dead which float around in one of the castle's rooms - beautiful lights which I thought were nothing special - into those bones, creating new skeleton servants.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	13	"[what]"
ch4_s1_f78a9ccb		One time she creates a zombie and I almost faint from the smell of death as it passes by me.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	14	"[what]"
ch4_s1_d355e624		One day when Yarlomila is not busy, I decide to have a serious talk with her.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	15	"[what]"
ch4_s1_2f84c3bb	d	Hey!	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	18	d "[what]"
ch4_s1_9bf39bbe	y	Oh, so you've decided to finally grace me with your beautiful voice?	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	19	y "[what]"
ch4_s1_d9ff1188	d	I won't sing for you. Ever! But we can talk.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	20	d "[what]"
ch4_s1_97a5a43f	y	Please go ahead. What would you like to talk about?	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	21	y "[what]"
ch4_s1_72996329	d	You. Why do you seem so sad? So lonely?	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	22	d "[what]"
ch4_s1_8b72edb7	y	Because as you can see there is no one here. I'm alone in this world.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	24	y "[what]"
ch4_s1_5d104ae4	y	Well, until you arrived. So I've decided to keep you. Now I have company.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	26	y "[what]"
ch4_s1_a11a5f45	d	Do you realise that as long as you keep me caged, I'll never want to be your friend?	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	28	d "[what]"
ch4_s1_06d6d9cd	y	Friend? That's too much to ask for someone such as I. The presence of another is enough for me.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	30	y "[what]"
ch4_s1_54c608fd		So she doesn't believe she can have friends. Do I want to be her friend? I guess I do, since from the first time I met her I felt like I wanted to save her...	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	31	"[what]"
ch4_s1_e8466203	d	Ok, I know what we should do, Yarlomila!	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	33	d "[what]"
ch4_s1_b83ad773	y	Yes?	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	34	y "[what]"
ch4_s1_80c3b74e	d	Let's get to know each other! Then we can decide if we can be friends!	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	35	d "[what]"
ch4_s1_194962be	y	If it means hearing your beautiful voice... Sure, let's talk.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	37	y "[what]"
end_songbird_4eaa8962		Days pass by and Yarlomila and I get to know each other better.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	54	"[what]"
end_songbird_47587645		I grow to like her, but she never lets me out of the cage and I can't convince her of the true value of friendship... because my so-called friends never come to rescue me.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	55	"[what]"
end_songbird_47c2e88e		I feel so disappointed when I think about it.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	57	"[what]"
end_songbird_19d1deb3		But I have Yarlomila now. I will talk only to her and sing only for her. And I will stay forever in this golden cage.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	59	"[what]"
end_songbird_06adfb5d	y	My Songbird...	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	61	y "[what]"

ch4_s2_zygmunt_9948a9a9		I kick the chair while screaming at the scepter's handle. As if it would answer. The only thing my outburst accomplishes is knocking the chair over.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	82	"[what]" with sshake
ch4_s2_zygmunt_8538fd30	b	Zygmunt, calm down!	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	84	b "[what]"

ch4_s2_zygmunt2a_54991096		When I went to wake Dobrava the morning after meeting Leshy, she was gone.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	92	"[what]"
ch4_s2_zygmunt2a_db6e57c4		We looked everywhere for her: the town, the forest, the ruins. Nothing. Not a single stone was left unturned, and yet we could not find her.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	93	"[what]"
ch4_s2_zygmunt2a_cee2ebb3		It's not like her to disappear on us like that... On me...	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	94	"[what]"

ch4_s2_andia_00e5911e		Because they are the wielder of the scepter. And since they're separated from the scepter, they can be found if someone who cares for them deeply touches it and thinks of them.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	366	"[what]"
ch4_s2_andia_0af1bd9f	a	It is a precaution the Elves put in place for situations such as the one we find ourselves in.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	368	a "[what]"
ch4_s2_andia_c296cd57	z	So all you need to do... is touch it and it will lead us to Dobrava?	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	369	z "[what]"
ch4_s2_andia_43b24468	b	Try it, Andia!	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	371	b "[what]"
ch4_s2_andia_810e230e	a	That's what the text says. It's an instruction for the usage of this artifact. I'm going to try it.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	373	a "[what]"
ch4_s2_andia_4c4543e2		I take the handle in my hand and picture Dobrava. Memories of our time together flash in my mind. I think about the times she was angry, sad, and hurt. Ready to cry and call it quits.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	375	"[what]"
ch4_s2_andia_e8d7ee18		But more importantly, I think about the times she had a brilliant smile on her face, her kindness and courage shining through all the more brightly. She's amazing.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	376	"[what]"
ch4_s2_andia_92806236		I take the handle in my hand and picture Dobrava. Memories of our time together flash in my mind. I think about the times they were angry, sad, and hurt. Ready to cry and call it quits.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	378	"[what]"

ch4_s2_andia_4dafecec		Then I feel the pull.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	380	"[what]"
ch4_s2_andia_91e2ad03	a	It's working!	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	382	a "[what]"
ch4_s2_andia_481cfb28	b	Really?	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	385	b "[what]"
ch4_s2_andia_2375be0c	a	No time to waste then, let's go!	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	387	a "[what]"
ch4_s2_andia_72acfec3		We gather our equipment and follow the pull of the scepter into the forest. We all have solemn expressions and don't talk while walking.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	398	"[what]"
ch4_s2_andia_6587eeef		We walk and we walk... further north than we have ever traveled before. Eventually the road ends and we start walking through the forest proper.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	399	"[what]"
ch4_s2_andia_2072f766		Further and further we go... into the heart of the forest.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	400	"[what]"
ch4_s2_andia_1b3c4f2b		The scepter pulls us to another Elven ruin. One in which we have not been before. We don't venture this far away from civilization.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	407	"[what]"
ch4_s2_andia_6c4a112b		I've been this far away only in the presence of Krasny Ludek. With them, I felt safe from the monsters and the dangers of the Priporovy Forest.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	408	"[what]"
ch4_s2_andia_6f057783		But for Dobrava I would go to the underworld and back. Anything that stands between us, I would surmount.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	409	"[what]"
ch4_s2_andia_ebfeb2e7		However, the ruin is abandoned. There is no life or undeath here. The scepter pulls us to what looks like a mirror.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	410	"[what]"
ch4_s2_andia_1d87c954	z	Hmm... what is this?	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	412	z "[what]"
ch4_s2_andia_e83dd2f3	a	Maybe I should try touching the scepter to it?	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	414	a "[what]"
ch4_s2_andia_1c21ca37		I do it and the mirror's surface starts shimmering with golden light. A whirlwind forms.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	415	"[what]"
ch4_s2_andia_9c8761bf	a	Ah... it's a portal!	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	418	a "[what]"
ch4_s2_andia_a5e77efb		I look at my companions and they nod.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	422	"[what]"
ch4_s2_andia_9dc57015	a	Let's go then! To rescue Dobrava!	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	423	a "[what]"
ch4_s2_andia_b3791bfb		We step through the portal.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	424	"[what]"
ch4_s3_45d48c9d	y	So will you sing for me today?	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	440	y "[what]"
ch4_s3_bdcfea0a		Should I? She's been asking me this for a few days now. I know it's important to her for some reason.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	441	"[what]"
ch4_s3_a05f55c0		Before I can make my decision though, there is a blinding flash of golden light. A portal opens in the middle of the throne room.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	442	"[what]" with flash
ch4_s3_4cbc03ff	y	What is light magic doing in my domain?!	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	444	y "[what]"
ch4_s3_8390aba9		From the portal three people emerge. I immediately recognise them.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	445	"[what]"
ch4_s3_6536d4b7		Zygmunt, Bogdan and then Andia come out one after another. The portal closes.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	454	"[what]"
ch4_s3_42267df3		Bogdan, Zygmunt and then Andia come out one after another. The portal closes.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	460	"[what]"
ch4_s3_d15f2233		Andia, Bogdan and then Zygmunt come out one after another. The portal closes.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	466	"[what]"
ch4_s3_482b54b0	a	Well, our one known exit closing isn't ideal...	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	468	a "[what]"
ch4_s3_4fd5a3a2		Then they notice the birdcage with me inside it.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	472	"[what]"
ch4_s3_ce49abec	z	Dobrava?! What the hell are you doing there?!	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	474	z "[what]"
ch4_s3_a5dec645	d	Just hanging around, I guess.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	476	d "[what]"
ch4_s3_380167b8	z	This is no time for jokes! Why are you in a cage? Who in the world would do something like this?!	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	479	z "[what]"
ch4_s3_132dba26	b	Dobrava?! What are you doing in there?!	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	481	b "[what]"
ch4_s3_c382415d	d	I'm trapped, as you can see.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	483	d "[what]"
ch4_s3_fe77d709	b	What the hell! I'll kill whoever has done this to you!	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	485	b "[what]"
ch4_s3_b2f91c99	a	Dobrava?! What in the world are you doing in a cage?!	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	487	a "[what]"
ch4_s3_05676ea4	d	I'm trapped here, I guess.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	489	d "[what]"
ch4_s3_64de436a	a	Who would dare imprison you?!	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	491	a "[what]"
ch4_s3_d6f523e0		They then notice Yarlomila standing next to the cage. She is smiling her creepy smile again, her eyes emotionless.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	496	"[what]"
ch4_s3_12f96fe9	y	Hello. Welcome to my domain.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	497	y "[what]"
ch4_s3_0793f24b	z	Who in the world are you?!	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	498	z "[what]"
ch4_s3_cafe6dab	b	Someone to fight, that's for sure!	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	499	b "[what]"
ch4_s3_2131e5b1	a	I think that's the necromancer Leshy tasked us with defeating.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	500	a "[what]"
ch4_s3_46e2c785	y	Correct! Now dear guests, do you want to defeat the great evil and become heroes?	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	502	y "[what]"
ch4_s3_f990d2e8		I notice she looks somewhat sad as she says that, regret and sorrow tinging her voice. It couldn't be... does she want to die and be freed from her loneliness and pain?	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	503	"[what]"
ch4_s3_83b17dcf		Is that why she has done all this? Did she capture me to lure my friends here and have them play heroes?	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	506	"[what]"
ch4_s3_2_486bd5e7		What does it matter why she's done it? She's evil after all. She's killed many and has played with the boundary between life and death. She should die.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	515	"[what]"
ch4_s3_2_29a255e9		Bogdan moves in to attack Yarlomila while holding her undead servants at bay. Zygmunt shoots arrows at her from behind and Andia prepares a spell.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	516	"[what]"
ch4_s3_2_610a48a7		Her incantation takes several moments, but the effect is spectacular when she finally casts it.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	517	"[what]"
ch4_s3_2_45ef6203		A whirlwind envelops the necromancer and raises her into the air. Up and up she goes towards the tall ceiling of the throne room.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	518	"[what]"
ch4_s3_2_7fb5f9ec		When Yarlomila reaches the room's ceiling, Andia releases the spell and the evil wizardess drops to the floor like a puppet whose strings have been cut.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	519	"[what]"
ch4_s3_2_915acaec		And she doesn't get up. For good measure, Bogdan stabs her with his sword.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	520	"[what]"
ch4_s3_2_969ad565		The castle of glass shatters.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	522	"[what]" with sshake
ch4_s3_2_e76b040f		We are back in an Elven ruin, one I have not seen before. But my friends seem familiar with this place. The birdcage crumbles and I fall on my butt on the remains of a tiled floor.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	535	"[what]"
ch4_s3_2_8ecec9fa		When I look around the room we find ourselves in what looks like the throne room I've been imprisoned in for so long. However, it's not made of glass but of crumbling stone instead.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	536	"[what]"
ch4_s3_2_d80f4754	d	I'm so glad you've killed her. That it's finally over...	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	538	d "[what]"
ch4_s3_3_9d6429ee		It can't end like this. I believe we can save Yarlomila from herself even more now that I've had the chance to speak with her. She's not irredeemable.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	543	"[what]"
ch4_s3_3_5473c8c0		Her means are evil, but her actions are the result of pain and loneliness. She doesn't deserve to die.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	544	"[what]"
ch4_s3_3_29a255e9		Bogdan moves in to attack Yarlomila while holding her undead servants at bay. Zygmunt shoots arrows at her from behind and Andia prepares a spell.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	545	"[what]"
ch4_s3_3_2792c02b		I notice it's a powerful one by how the magic shifts around her. If she succeeds in casting that, it's over.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	546	"[what]"
ch4_s3_3_6ea0ed35	d	Andia! Help me get out of here!	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	548	d "[what]"
ch4_s3_3_5d748595		She hesitates for a moment.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	550	"[what]"
ch4_s3_3_6b62e4b4	d	Andia! I don't want to be here. I can't stand it any longer!	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	551	d "[what]"
ch4_s3_3_11fccb5b		That seals the deal and Andia comes closer to the cage. She breaks the lock using a blast of magic and opens the door. I jump out immediately.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	552	"[what]"
ch4_s3_3_e81d8ea8	d	Thank you!	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	554	d "[what]"
ch4_s3_3_61c05271	b	Ouch!	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	556	b "[what]"
ch4_s3_3_ef590558		Bogdan yells in pain. I look at him and his arm is scorched, covered by black miasma. That's a curse that I don't have the ability to lift.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	558	"[what]"
ch4_s3_3_8653e754	d	Shit!	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	560	d "[what]"
ch4_s3_3_baf71bc6		We will have to see a priest about it later.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	561	"[what]"
ch4_s3_3_3fbf62e6	a	Here's your flute. You had better be ready to fight.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	563	a "[what]"
ch4_s3_3_3b4c7c7a		Andia looks annoyed. I guess she thinks Bogdan got hurt because of the delay my release caused.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	564	"[what]"
ch4_s3_3_4f4bbe57	d	Do you have the scepter too, Andia?	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	566	d "[what]"
ch4_s3_3_673b0382	a	Zygmunt has it. But now is not the time to-	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	569	a "[what]"
ch4_s3_3_c5896a1a		I run up to Zygmunt and scream at him to give me the scepter's handle. He looks confused but I must look very determined because he gives it to me without any questions.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	570	"[what]"
ch4_s3_3_43129362	a	Bogdan has it. But now is not the time to-	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	572	a "[what]"
ch4_s3_3_3c093c47		I run up to Bogdan, into the center of the fight.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	573	"[what]"
ch4_s3_3_5ceb0a55	b	Dobrava, what are you-	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	576	b "[what]"
ch4_s3_3_c13f9ea1	d	Give me the scepter's handle!	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	577	d "[what]"
ch4_s3_3_a418b705		Bogdan looks confused but I must look very determined because he gives it to me without any questions.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	578	"[what]"
ch4_s3_3_8196ffb4	a	I have it here. But now is not the time to-	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	580	a "[what]"
ch4_s3_3_366f937f	d	Give it to me!	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	581	d "[what]"
ch4_s3_3_78db813d		Andia looks confused but I must look very determined because she gives it to me without any questions.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	582	"[what]"
ch4_s3_3_79554199		With the scepter in hand, I run up to the throne where the shining yellow jewel still sits. I put it in its place in the scepter. Then I point the weapon at Yarlomila.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	589	"[what]"
ch4_s3_3_45f2de76		I know what to do. I sing in ancient Elven - a language I've never spoken in my life - as the correct words somehow fill my head.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	590	"[what]"
ch4_s3_3_93ae50a4	d	Light vanquish darkness, bring good to evil, cleanse the heart of the necromancer and break the walls of the castle of glass!	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	591	d "[what]"
ch4_s3_3_d04273c6		There is a blinding flash of light, seemingly brighter than the sun. I cover my eyes.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	592	"[what]"
ch4_s3_3_4c97a5e1		Then I feel warmth. Safety. Comfort. I feel joy and happiness. So much so that I could cry.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	593	"[what]"
ch4_s3_3_686b52ef		The sounds of fighting cease. Yarlomila screams but her screams quickly turn into sobs of relief.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	595	"[what]"
ch4_s3_3_969ad565		The castle of glass shatters.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	597	"[what]" with sshake
ch4_s3_3_3b0cf0b2		We are back in an Elven ruin, one I have not seen before. But my friends seem familiar with this place.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	612	"[what]"

ch4_s3_3_28931bdd		Yarlomila is sitting on the floor sobbing and my friends stand around her, weapons drawn, but confused about what to do.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	614	"[what]"
ch4_s3_3_63fb9b57	d	Let her be. She's not evil anymore. I cleansed her heart.	game/story scripts/ch4.rpy	616	d "[what]"
